        "question": "However, until now, the best transition metal silicide compound was found to be the higher manganese silicide (HMS) compound with a dimensionless figure of merit ZT = 0.5 to 0.7 at about 500 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C [1]. But the problems of stability of the HMS and the lack of knowledge of the Mn-Si phase diagram are very challenging. This shows that the stability issues are also of fundamental interest in the search of new materials for high temperature applications. It is worth noting that no study has focused on the potential for thermoelectricity of transition metal silicides with a low Si content such as M\\({}_{5}\\)Si\\({}_{3}\\) (M=Ta,W), which we have recently begun to study [3, 4]. Thus, the aim of the present study is to determine the equilibrium structure of Ta\\({}_{5}\\)Si\\({}_{3}\\) and W\\({}_{5}\\)Si\\({}_{3}\\) which are stable above 2000C [3, 4] and to determine their thermopower using Mott's law.\n\n**Computational details**Which transition metal silicide compound is considered to have the best figure of merit for thermoelectric applications around 500Â°C, despite challenges in stability and phase diagram knowledge?",

        "question": "First-principles calculations are performed by using the scalar relativistic all-electron Blochl's projector augmented-wave (PAW) method [5, 6] within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as implemented in the highly-efficient Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [7, 8]. In the standard mode, VASP performs a fully relativistic calculation for the core-electrons and treats valence electrons in a scalar relativistic approximation. For the GGA exchange- correlation function, the Perdew-Wang parameterization (PW91) [9, 10] is employed. Here we adopted the standard version of the PAW potentials for Si, W and Ta atoms. A plane-wave energy cutoff of 450 eV is held constant for the study of the different M\\({}_{5}\\)Si\\({}_{3}\\) compounds. Brillouin zone integrations are performed using Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes [11], and the Methfessel-Paxton technique [12] with a smearing parameter of 0.2 eV. The reciprocal space (k-point) meshes are increased to achieve convergence to a precision of 1meV/atom. The total energy is converged numerically to less than 1\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-6}\\) eV/unit with respect to electronic, ionic and unit cell degrees of freedom, and the latter two are relaxed using calculated forces with a preconditioned conjugated gradient algorithm. After structural optimization, calculated forces are converged to less than 0.01eV/A. All calculations are performed using the \"high\" precision setting within the VASP input file to avoid wrap-around errors.Which method is typically employed for performing scalar relativistic and fully relativistic calculations in first-principles simulations, particularly focusing on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for energy minimization?",

This system exists in four crystalline phases: Tl\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\), TlTe, Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\), and Tl\\({}_{2}\\)Te [8].

Nevertheless we have a disagreement concerning the sign of \\(\\alpha\\). This is not surprising since looking at Fig.1a one sees that the Fermi level is located in a region in which the density of states changes very rapidly and thus a slight change in the approximations used in the calculations can induce a change of slope of the density of states at E\\({}_{\\text{f}}\\) : we are probably at the limits of validity of the application of Mott's Law. For the determination of the thermopower of the doped compounds, we have to take into account that they are semiconducting and Mott's law is _a priori_ only valid for metals. However, as can be seen in ref. [10], the resistivity has a metallic behaviour and the thermal dependence of the thermopower is relatively close to the linear behaviour expected in the Mott's law. Therefore applying the rigid band model [26], knowing the concentration of charge carriers and finally applying Mott's law, we can roughly estimate the thermopower. Since only one band is filled and because of the metallic behaviour observed in these compounds, we expect that this crude method can give qualitatively the thermoelectric properties of the doped compounds.When applying Mott's law to semiconducting compounds to estimate thermopower, which of the following considerations is crucial in ensuring a reasonable approximation?",

The thermodynamics, phase stability and spinodal decomposition in TiAlN have been analyzed [2; 3], also on the influence of nitrogen off-stoichiometry [4] and pressure [5]. Furthermore, the theoretical prediction of the mixing enthalpy when alloying TiAlN with Cr has resulted in a general design route to improve the thermal stability of hard coatings [6]. Recently, the importance of the significant elastic anisotropy in TiAlN on the isostructural spinodal decomposition has been discussed [7; 8].

The approach models the substitutional disordered alloys with ordered superstructures. The basic structural element of the SQS model is a supercell, what is aimed to capture the structural short range order (SRO) in alloys while its periodic repetition introduces spatial long range order (LRO) [18]. The degree of SRO is usually measured by the Warren-Cowley parameter [21], which for a pseudobinary A\\({}_{1-x}\\)B\\({}_{x}\\)N alloy is defined as \\(\\alpha_{j}=1-P_{B}(R)/x_{B}\\), where \\(P_{B}(R)\\) is the probability of finding a \\(B\\) atom at a distance \\(R\\) from an \\(A\\) atom and \\(x_{B}\\) stands for the concentration of \\(B\\). A perfectly random alloy is characterized by vanishing SRO, while \\(\\alpha>0\\) and \\(\\alpha<0\\) define clustering and ordering, respectively. In terms of modeling disorder, approximate SQS supercells with with small or vanishing SROs up to a certain neighboring order can be compared if and only if the interaction parameters are also known. In this work the atomic configurations in the supercells were obtained by including the Warren-Cowley SRO parameters of the first seven nearest-neighboring shells. Namely, the disorder has been considered up to the seventh neighboring shell on the metal sublattice. Accordingly, the SRO parameters were calculated only on the Ti-sublattice. In order to achieve the closest possible model of the perfectly random alloy in the chosen sized and shaped supercell approximation (\\(A\\times B\\times C\\)), a Metropolis-type simulated annealing algorithm [22] has been applied with a cost-function built from the properly weighted nearest-neighbor SRO parameters.In the context of modeling substitutional disordered alloys, what is the primary role of the Warren-Cowley parameter in evaluating the degree of short-range order (SRO)?",

        "question": "The SQS supercell approach in general breaks the local point symmetry at different stages. The substitutional disorder changes the microscopic local environments which results also in some distorsions on the lattice parameters. Namely, after full relaxation the supercells will have a general triclinic shape. Moreover, the SQS approach in modeling the substitutional disorder of alloys allows one to apply arbitrary supercell shape and size - (\\(A\\times B\\times C\\)) in terms of lattice vectors. This arbitrariness though increases the variational freedom to obtain closely vanishing SRO parameters with relative small supercell size at any alloy composition, it also spoils the symmetry of the model. Thus, the elasticity of the B1 Ti\\({}_{0.5}\\)Al\\({}_{0.5}\\)N alloy is modeled with fully relaxed SQS supercells an it is described by 21 elastic constants, instead of the three principal cubic constants, \\(C_{11}\\), \\(C_{12}\\) and \\(C_{44}\\). Namely, in the SQS approach the elastic tensor of the model belongs to a symmetry class that is lower than the one that the alloy shows experimentally. Furthermore, different SQS supercells break the symmetry somewhat differently, which means that the comparison of the results can only be done after certain alignment. In this study we show that a projection technique can provide such an alignment in the example of the B1 Ti\\({}_{0.5}\\)Al\\({}_{0.5}\\)N alloy.Which of the following statements best describes the impact of the SQS supercell approach on the symmetry and elastic properties of alloys?",

The exchange correlation energy was approximated by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient functional (PBE-GGA) [25]. The plane-wave cutoff energy together with the Monkhorst-Pack sampling [26] of the Brillouine zone were tested and sufficient convergence was achieved. The pseudopotentials were downloaded from the library linked to Quantum Espresso and tested by calculating the elasticity of bulk B1 AlN and TiN in agreement with literature values [16; 27]. In obtaining the ground state structure of the modeling supercells, both the lattice parameters and the internal atomic coordinates were relaxed by using the extended molecular dynamics method with variable cell shape introduced by Wentzcovitch [28]. Accordingly, during the relaxation the supercells geometries have been changed from the initial cubic-like lattice structure and converged to a slightly distorted triclinic shape with vanishing stress tensor. Thus, we avoid any residual structural stresses, which is essential in performing an accurate comparative analysis of the calculated elastic tensors. In this dynamics, a value of 0.02 KBar was taken as convergence threshold for the pressure.

        "question": "In this section we present a comparative analysis of the calculated approximate elastic tensors obtained for the cubic (B1) TiA\\({}_{0.5}\\)l\\({}_{0.5}\\)N alloy within the special quasirandom structure approach. To get different levels of the approximation of the elasticity in cubic Ti\\({}_{0.5}\\)Al\\({}_{0.5}\\)N, several approximate SQS supercell models have been generated with different shape and size, such as \\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\), \\((2\\times 3\\times 2)\\), \\((4\\times 3\\times 2)\\), \\((4\\times 3\\times 4)\\), \\((4\\times 4\\times 3)\\) and \\((4\\times 4\\times 4)\\). Here SQS supercell sizes are measured in terms of the fcc unit vectors. To have a more complete comparison of the calculated elastic tensors, we present results obtained with the ordered L1\\({}_{0}\\) structure and three other structures, denoted here by C1-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\), C3-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) and B1-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\). These three structures are not based on the fcc unit cell but on the fcc Bravais cell. The C1-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) and C3-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) was created by Mayrhofer et al. [16] with considering the number of bonds between the host and doping atoms. The C3-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) structure was designed with preserving the cubic symmetry. The B1-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) structure was obtained by von Pezold with using a Monte-Carlo scheme and averaging over the three orthogonal main crystallographic directions. The SRO parameters of all superstructures are summarized in Table 1. In the case of the \\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\), \\((2\\times 3\\times 2)\\) and \\((4\\times 4\\times 4)\\) supercells, those atomic configurations have been chosen that resulted closest to randomness in our approximation, i.e. almost vanishing SRO parameters up to the seventh neighbor shell. The larger SROs in case of the \\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) supercell are the consequence of the low configurational freedom in the supercell and indicate less perfection in the randomness. In the case of the \\((4\\times 3\\times 2)\\) supercell size two different atomic configurations have been considered with very different SRO parameters. The \\(*\\) marks the SQS structure that is less random. The calculated SROs of the C1-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) and C3-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) structures show alternating systematics that is related to the used construction strategy. The SRO parameters deviate considerably from zero in these two cases. For example, the cubic symmetric C3-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\) shows perfect ordering in every second neighboring shell. In comparing the SRO values in Table 1, the \\((4\\times 4\\times 4)\\) supercell gives unambiguously the closest model of a totally random(pseudo-)binary alloy in our SQS approximation.Which supercell size provides the most accurate approximation of a totally random pseudo-binary alloy for calculating elastic tensors within the special quasirandom structure (SQS) approach?",

These elastic constants are given in Table 3. The deviations of these constants from the projected cubic elastic constants are shown in Fig. 2. In this figure the three columns for each supercell give the deviations along the three orthogonal directions, [100], [010] and [001]. One can see in the figure, where the horizontal lines show our 3% error threshold, that in the 9 dimensional space only three supercells, the \\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\), C3-\\((2\\times 2\\times)\\) and \\((4\\times 4\\times 4)\\) give cubic elastic symmetry. Similarly to Fig. 1 the \\((4\\times 4\\times 3)\\) supercells performs very well, while the totally random \\((4\\times 3\\times 4)\\) does not. Accordingly, Fig. 2 correlates quite well with Fig. 1, namely we see the same set of structures that performing perfectly good or bad. This leads us to the conclusion that one can analyze the performance of the supercells in describing cubic elasticity within this 9 dimensional subspace, too. This means a great reduction in the computational cost, since only 9 elements have to be calculated to measure the representation of elasticity. By the way, the analysis in this 9 dimensional subspace might result in another best approximate superstructure, like in this study.

The 3% numerical error accumulates in the nominator and results in the approximate 5% difference between the two elastic anisotropy values obtained with the best \\((4\\times 4\\times 4)\\) and \\((4\\times 4\\times 3)\\) supercells. Thus, the Zener's elastic anisotropy in Ti\\({}_{0.5}\\)Al\\({}_{0.5}\\)N should have the value of A=1.40 with around 6% numerical error. Fig.4shows not only the cubic projected elastic anisotropy values but also their variation along the three orthogonal directions, [100], [010] and [001], using the data from Table 3. For example, in the [100] direction one has \\(A(x,y,z)=2C_{44}/(C_{11}-C12)\\) while in the [010], \\(A(yzx)=2C_{66}/(C_{33}-C_{13})\\). These orientational variations should vanish in case of true cubic symmetry. However, as the figure shows one may get a large orientation dependence (\\(\\approx 55\\%\\), see C1-\\((2\\times 2\\times 2)\\)) for a supercell being far from fulfilling cubic point symmetry.

This six-fold degeneracy can be lifted by strain or quantum confinement, e.g., it separates into a four-fold degeneracy and a two-fold one in [001] quantum wells. The two-fold degenerate valleys with low energy can be further lifted by a valley splitting due to the interface scattering.[26; 27] The existence of the valley degree of freedom makes the Si-based qubits more attractive.[7; 8; 9; 10; 11] Moreover, the mature micro-fabrication technology of the classical Si-based electronics is proposed to benefit the realization of Si spin qubits.[7; 8]Which characteristic of silicon quantum dots makes them especially promising for use in spin qubits?",

Raith _et al.[32]_ calculated the energy spectrum and the spin relaxation time in one-electron QDs. By explicitly including the electron-electron Coulomb interaction, Wang _et al._ obtained the two-electron spectrum from exact-diagonalization method and calculated the singlet-triplet relaxation time in both single[8] and lateral coupled double[10] QDs. As pointed out by Barnes _et al._,[33] the robustness of the quantum states against charge impurity and noise in QDs can be improved by increasing the number of the electrons, which reveals the necessity of the theoretical investigation on multi-electron spin qubits. The energy spectra in multi-electron GaAs QDs have been explicitly calculated to identify the specific spin configuration of each state, where only one valley is relevant.[34; 35; 36; 37; 38] However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the explicit calculation in silicon QDs with three or more electrons due to the complication of the calculation. Alternatively, Hada _et al.[39]_ neglected the correlation effect and calculated the three-electron energy spectrum within single configuration approximation in single QDs. However, the correlation effect has been shown to present significant influence on the energy spectrum via strong Coulomb interaction in Si QDs.[8; 39; 40] Therefore, in order to obtain the accurate convergent spectrum, the exact-diagonalization method with sufficient basis functions is required. The goal of the present work isto analyze the energy spectrum in the three-electron Si/SiGe QDs based on the exact-diagonalization method.Which method is essential for obtaining an accurate and convergent energy spectrum in the study of three-electron silicon quantum dots (Si QDs)?",

        "question": "In this work, we calculate the three-electron energy spectrum in both single and vertically coupled double QDs with the Zeeman splitting, SOC, valley coupling and electron-electron Coulomb interaction explicitly included. In the single dot case, we first calculate the ground state energy in the absence of the magnetic field, where good agreement with the experimental data is achieved. Our calculation also uncovers the valley and spin configurations of the ground state in experiment. We present a complete phase-diagram-like picture to describe the spin and valley configurations of the ground state. We find that the ground state is of pure (mixed) valley configuration at large (small) valley splitting. The spin configuration of the ground state can be controlled through dot size for the pure valley configuration, while that in the mixed valley configuration is always doublet. The magnetic field dependence of the three-electron energy spectrum in each \"phase\" is investigated. We take into account both orbital effect and Zeeman splitting for the perpendicular magnetic field and only Zeeman splitting for the parallel magnetic field owing to the strong confinement along the growth direction. We find that the spin configuration of the ground state can also be switched by magnetic field. For the mixed valley configuration, we find interesting quartet-doublet degeneracy, which results from the negligibly small intervalley interaction. In the DQD case, the barrier-width and barrier-height dependences of the energy spectrum with both pure and mixed valley configurations are discussed. Moreover, we show many anticrossing points resulting from the SOCs in all cases.Which configuration of the spin state is always observed in the ground state when there is a mixed valley configuration in quantum dots?",

Then, we calculate the ground state energies of one-, two- and three-electron cases by treating \\(d_{0}\\) as a parameter and determine its value by the least square method of \\(\\Delta\\mu_{1}\\) and \\(\\Delta\\mu_{2}\\).[48] In the previous section, we only introduce the frame of the three-electron case. For the one-electron case, one needs to diagonalize the single-electron Hamiltonian \\(H_{e}\\) as given in Eq. (2), while for the two-electron case we follow the frame in Ref. [8].In a theoretical study of multi-electron systems, what method can be used to obtain the ground state energies when experimental measurements for valley splittings are unavailable or too small to measure?",

        "question": "The origination of the variation of the ground state spin configuration in the \"\\(-\\)\"-configuration regime is found to be the competition between the orbital and Coulomb energies. The relative orbital (Coulomb) energy between the lowest quartet and doublet \\(\\Delta E_{\\rm o}\\) (\\(\\Delta E_{C}\\)) is defined as the orbital (Coulomb) energy of the lowest quartet subtracting that of lowest doublet. One calculates the orbital energy from the expectation of \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}H_{e}^{i}\\) of the three-electron eigenstates, while the Coulomb energy is similarly given by \\(H_{C}^{12}+H_{C}^{13}+H_{C}^{23}\\). From the explicit expressions of the quartet and doublet given in Appendix B, one notices that all three electrons in quartet must occupy different orbits while two electrons in doublet can stay in the same one. Therefore, the lowest quartet states have higher orbital energy than the lowest doublet states (\\(\\Delta E_{\\rm o}>0\\)). We finds that the Coulomb interaction of the lowest quartet states is smaller than that of the lowest doublet states (\\(\\Delta E_{C}<0\\)). In Fig. 1(b), we plot \\(\\Delta E_{\\rm o}\\) and \\(-\\Delta E_{C}\\) as function of effective diameter, where an intersecting between these two quantities can be seen. As a qualitative understanding, \\(\\Delta E_{\\rm o}\\propto 1/d_{0}^{2}\\) can be characterized from \\(\\hbar\\omega_{0}=\\hbar^{2}\\pi/(m_{t}d_{0}^{2})\\), while \\(\\Delta E_{C}\\propto 1/d_{0}\\) is estimated from \\(e^{2}/(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\kappa d_{0})\\). Therefore, the orbital energy is more sensitive to the diameter than the Coulomb interaction. For a small diameter QD, the relative position between the lowest doublet and quartet is dominated by the orbital energy and the ground state is doublet. As \\(d_{0}\\) increases, \\(\\Delta E_{\\rm o}\\) can become smaller than \\(-\\Delta E_{C}\\) with the crossover at \\(d_{0}\\sim 26\\) nm in Fig. 1(b), resulting in the transition of the ground state from doublet to quartet.Which factor primarily influences the transition of the ground state from doublet to quartet as the effective diameter of the quantum dot increases?",

        "question": "In this part, we take advantage of our model to calculate the three-electron energy spectrum with \"\\(-\\)\"-valley configuration. We study the perpendicular magnetic field dependence at \\(d=2.12\\) nm (corresponding to \\(\\Delta E_{0}^{\\rm v}\\approx 1.9\\) meV) with \\(d_{0}=20\\) nm and \\(29\\) nm, where the ground states lie in the \\((-,1/2)\\) and \\((-,3/2)\\) configuration regimes, respectively. The lowest few energy levels are plotted as function of \\(B_{\\perp}\\) in Fig. 2. These eigenstates are denoted as \\(Q_{-3/2}^{(-)}\\), \\(Q_{-1/2}^{(-)}\\), \\(Q_{1/2}^{(-)}\\), \\(Q_{3/2}^{(-)}\\), \\(D_{-1/2}^{(-)}\\) and \\(D_{1/2}^{(-)}\\), according to the total spin \\(S_{\\rm tot}\\) and \\(S_{z}\\) of the major components in these states. The lowest doublet (quartet) states at \\(B_{\\perp}=0\\) T are labeled as circle (open triangle). It is seen that the ground state for \\(d_{0}=20\\) nm is four-fold degenerate doublet, while that for \\(d_{0}=29\\) nm is quartet, consistent with Fig. 1(a). As the magnetic field increases, the degeneracy is lifted due to the effect of the magnetic field on Landau level and Zeeman splitting, resulting in many intersecting points as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). We find that some intersecting points show anticrossing behavior due to the SOCs.[8] In this work, all the anticrossing points are labeled by open squares. In the inset, we enlarge the spectrum in the vicinity of one anticrossing point at \\(B_{\\perp}\\sim 0.72\\) T, where an energy gap \\(\\sim 0.24\\)\\(\\mu\\)eV is present.[19; 20; 21] As reported, the anticrossing points are important for spin manipulation, due to the strong spin mixed at these points.[8; 10; 50; 51; 52; 53; 54]When analyzing the magnetic field dependence of a three-electron system in a \"+-\"-valley configuration, what is the key implication of observing anticrossing points in the energy spectrum, particularly with regards to spin manipulation?",

        "question": "Since the eigenstates are strongly mixed, e.g., the largest component in the ground states is usually in the order of 20%, one can not naively describe an eigenstate by a single basis function. However, away from the anticrossing points, the SOCs are weak and the total orbital angular momentum \\(L=l_{1}+l_{2}+l_{3}\\) is still a good quantum number. In Fig. 2(a), we labeled this quantum number for each state. With this quantum number, one can understand why an intersecting point is anticrossing or not in the presence of SOCs. By rewriting the SOCs in the form of ladder operators, one obtains \\(H_{\\rm so}=\\frac{2iq_{0}}{\\hbar}(P^{+}S^{-}-P^{-}S^{+})-\\frac{2b_{0}}{\\hbar}(P^{+} S^{+}+P^{-}S^{-})\\) with \\(P^{\\pm}=(P_{x}\\pm iP_{y})/2\\) and \\(S^{\\pm}=S_{x}\\pm iS_{y}\\). Since \\(P^{\\pm}\\) (\\(S^{\\pm}\\)) changes \\(L\\) (\\(S_{z}\\)) by one unit, the states with (\\(L\\), \\(S_{z}\\)) can only couple with the states with (\\(L\\mp 1\\), \\(S_{z}\\pm 1\\)) via Rashba term and those with (\\(L\\pm 1\\), \\(S_{z}\\pm 1\\)) via IIA term.[8] For example, in the inset of Fig. 2(a), the spin-down doublet with (\\(1,-\\frac{1}{2}\\)) (black chain curve) couples with the quartet with (\\(0\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) (purple dashed curve) via IIA term, resulting in the anticrossing behavior.In a system where the spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) are rewritten using ladder operators, which of the following quantum numbers is preserved in regions away from anticrossing points?",

        "question": "In summary, we have studied three-electron energy spectra in Si/SiGe single QDs and vertically coupled DQDs by using the exact-diagonalization method. In our calculation, the Zeeman splitting, SOC, valley coupling and electron-electron Coulomb interaction are explicitly included. Due to the strong Coulomb interaction, a large number of basis functions are employed to converge the energy spectrum. The ground state energies in single QDs show good agreement with the experiment. As a supplement of the experimental data, we identify the valley configuration, spin configuration and the degeneracy factor of the ground state from our calculation. We then systematically study the ground state configuration in the absence of magnetic field, and find that the ground state is of pure and mixed valley configurations with large and small valley splittings, respectively. We show that the ground state with mixed valley configuration is always doublet. In contrast, the ground state with pure valley configuration is doublet in small dots, while it can be quartet in large dots. Then, we explicitly study the energy spectra of the three-electron states with two typical valley configurations, i.e., pure and mixed valley states, in the presence of perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields. In the pure valley configuration case, we show that the doublet-quartet transition of the ground state can be realized by tuning the magnetic field and/or dot size. For the mixed valley configuration, the doublet-quartet transition of the ground state can also be realized by magnetic field and the three-electron energy spectrum presents interesting quartet-doublet degeneracy, which is connected with the negligible intervalley coupling. Due to the spin-orbit coupling, the intersecting points between the energy levels with identical valley configuration but different spin quantum numbers can present anticrossing behavior, which is expected to benefit the manipulation of spin. We point out and analyze all these anticrossing points in each case. Furthermore, we study the barrier-width and barrier-height dependences of the three-electron energy spectrum in vertically strong-coupled DQDs. We also find anticrossing points in the pure valley configuration case and quartet-doublet degeneracy in the mixed configuration case.Which factor, according to quantum dot research, influences the realization of a doublet-to-quartet transition in both pure and mixed valley configurations of the ground state?",

Liu and Li [16] have studied the inter-chain coupling in simple networks consisting of different one dimensional nonlinear chains. They reported that the coupling between chains has different functions in heat conduction comparing with that in electric current. However, the double-chains they have studied, which are coupled together only with two particles, are far different from the true double-stranded structure. For two dimensions nonlinear systems, which are much similar to double-stranded and multi-stranded lattices, Lee and Dhar [17] have performed simulations to determine the system size (\\(L\\)) dependence of the heat current (\\(J\\)).

        "question": "shown in the inset of Figs.5c and 5d, the thermal conductivity is finite in the diffusive region and infinite in the ballistic region. Diffusive and ballistic regions are respectively corresponding to large and small temperature differences. When the intra-chain coupling increases, the temperature different in the chain decreases, which indicate the thermal transport mode exhibits a transition from the diffusive to the ballistic transport. Ballistic transport means less collision of phonon and then the thermal current will increase. Therefore, it is easily understand why the intra-chain coupling always enhances the thermal current in the chain. For the inter-chain coupling, as shown in Fig.5c, the inter-chain coupling cannot change the temperature profile of the chain in the case of weak nonlinear potential. However, Figure 5d displays the thermal transport mode exhibits a transition from the diffusive to the ballistic transport when inter-chain coupling increases in the case of strong nonlinear potential. The strong inter-chain interaction refers to strong on-site potential or large effective mass of the particle, which performs negative effects on the heat current. The competitive effects of strong on-site potential (negative effect) and the ballistic transport (positive effect) determine the influence of inter-chain coupling on thermal conductance. In the case of weak nonlinear potential, the transport mode is fixed and then the thermal conductance decreases with the inter-chain interaction increases. In the case of strong nonlinear potential, the on-site potential is strong enough; therefore the transition from diffusive to ballistic transport will increase the heat current.What influences the transition from diffusive to ballistic transport in a thermal chain, and how do different couplingsâboth intra- and inter-chainâaffect this transition under varying conditions of nonlinearity?",

It is reported that the interactions of the intra and inter-chain exhibit different thermal transport properties. In any case, the intra-chain interaction always upgrades the thermal conductance. The inter-chain interaction, however, has both positive and negative effects on the thermal conductance: the positive effect at the strong nonlinear potential and the negative effect at the weak nonlinear potential. Moreover, the changes of the phonon spectra of the particles, which are induced by intra-chain interaction, are quite different from those induced by inter-chain interaction. It is suggested that a simple coupling between the particles, which is a common point for both intra-chain and inter-chain interaction, can develop various thermal transport phenomenaWhat factor primarily differentiates the effects of intra-chain and inter-chain interactions on the thermal conductance of a double-stranded FK lattice in a complex thermal system?",

        "question": "of magnitude for conventional ferromagnetic alloys.[37] Thus, we can assumedly regard \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for our CFS as 3 \\(\\pm\\) 1 nm at room temperature (\\(\\lambda_{\\rm CFS}\\)).[12] Here for Fe-based Heusler compounds there is almost no information on \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\). Since \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for Fe films was reported as 8 nm at 4.2 K,[38]\\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for Fe-based alloys is naively expected to be shorter than 8 nm at 4.2 K. At room temperature, further short \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for Fe-based alloys can be expected. Thus, \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) = 8 nm can be considered to be the upper limit of \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for our FS. On the other hand, for Py (one of the alloys including Fe), \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) was reported to be 2 nm at room temperature.[21; 39] This can be considered to be the lower limit. Considering the assumable upper and lower limits of \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for our FS (\\(\\lambda_{\\rm FS}\\)), we should realistically regard \\(\\lambda_{\\rm FS}\\) as 5 \\(\\pm\\) 1 nm at room temperature. The estimated \\(P\\) as a function of \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\) is shown in Fig. 4(b), where \\(\\rho_{\\rm N}\\) and \\(\\lambda_{\\rm N}\\) are 2.5 \\(\\mu\\Omega\\)cm and 500 nm,[24; 21] respectively. The \\(P\\) values for CFS/Cu LSVs are larger than those for FS/Cu ones. In this figure, we can also see nearly monotonic enhancement in \\(P\\) with decreasing \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\). This fact means that highly ordered Heusler-compound electrodes have large \\(P\\), consistent with general interpretations.[34; 35; 36; 40] Note that this correlation between \\(P\\) and \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\) can also reproduce our previous result (\\(P\\)\\(\\sim\\) 0.56 for \\(\\rho_{\\rm CFS}\\)\\(\\sim\\) 90 \\(\\mu\\Omega\\)cm).[24] For these reasons, this analysis based on the NLSV measurements and the one-dimensional spin diffusion model is a universal method for fairly evaluating the spin polarization of Heusler-compound thin films. Since the large \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\) value is effective to enhance \\(\\Delta R_{\\rm S}A\\),[21] one should not simply regard the large \\(\\Delta R_{\\rm S}A\\) as a consequence of the large \\(P\\) in Heusler compounds, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b).Which of the following most accurately describes the relationship between spin polarization (P) and resistivity (Ï_F) in Fe-based Heusler-compound electrodes at room temperature?",

        "question": "We finally comment on the validity of the analysis described above. In Fig. 4(a) all the \\(\\Delta R_{\\rm S}A\\) values for CFS/Cu LSVs fabricated are larger than those for FS/Cu LSVs even if we take into account the dispersion of \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\). In comparison with FS/Cu LSVs (higher \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\)), CFS/Cu LSVs have relatively large \\(\\Delta R_{\\rm S}A\\) values despite the generally lower \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\). This indicates that the relatively large \\(\\Delta R_{\\rm S}A\\) observed in CFS/Cu LSVs are not arising from the large \\(\\rho_{\\rm F}\\) of CFS. The large \\(P\\) or long \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for CFS should be considered as an origin of the large \\(\\Delta R_{\\rm S}A\\) for CFS/Cu LSVs. Recently, we obtained the relatively large \\(P\\) value (\\(P\\) = 0.59) for one of our CFS films,[41] measured by the PCAR method. This value is larger than that of FS films (\\(P\\) = 0.45) reported by Ionescu _et al.[42]_ On the other hand, \\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) for CFS(Al) can be predicted to be relatively short (\\(\\lambda_{\\rm F}\\) = 3 \\(\\pm\\) 1 nm),[12] almost the same as conventional ferromagnets.[37; 38] Considering these actual data, we infer that the large \\(P\\) of our CFS is a main origin of the relatively large \\(\\Delta R_{\\rm S}A\\) for CFS/Cu LSVs compared with FS/Cu LSVs.Examining the magnetoresistance properties of two types of lateral spin valves (LSVs), CFS/Cu and FS/Cu, suggests that a particular parameter significantly influences the spin resistance-area product (\textit{\textDelta R\textsubscript{S}A}) in CFS/Cu LSVs as compared to FS/Cu LSVs.

The measurements were performed at room temperature, and time for a single measurement was 20 minutes. To confirm the efficacy of multi-peak analysis by comparing with the single-peak analysis, the sample C was measured four times under the same measurement conditions. There may be slight differences in position among the four measurements because multiple samples were set on the goniometer and they were scanned through the measurement. Measurement for the powder samples in sealed cylindrical aluminum holders were carried out by using a radial collimator of 2 mm width[13]. The bore and outer diameters of all the aluminum holders are 8 and 10 mm, respectively. Calibration of TOF and lattice spacing \\(d\\) was performed using CeO\\({}_{2}\\) powder as a standard sample certificated by NIST, and conversion parameters were determined. Because the volume fraction of Nb\\({}_{3}\\)Al was small in all the samples, we used the high intensity mode with a sample-slit width of 5 mm for the incident neutron beam..

Furthermore, according to molecular dynamics simulations, hybrid C-BN armchair nanotubes can be spontaneously formed via the connection of zigzag-edged BN and graphene nanoribbons (BNNR and GNR) at room temperature,[11] and their stability can be competitive with that of the corresponding pristine BNNTs and CNTs.[14] These zigzag-edged heterostructures are particularly appealing for spintronic applications, as the polarity of the BNNR gives an interfacial dipole, hence an effective electric field acting on the graphene ribbon.[15] It has been predicted that half-metallicity can be induced in zigzag-GNRs by application of a sufficiently large in-plane electric field perpendicular to the edges of the ribbon.[16]Which factor primarily contributes to the energetic stability of domain-separated C and BN nanosheets and nanotubes in hybrid nanostructures?",

        "question": "Magnetism in zigzag-edged graphene-based nanostructures is related to the presence of electronic states that are mainly localized at the edges.[17] These states seem to be ubiquitous in hexagonal structures with zigzag borders[18], and are not present in armchair edges. Roughness and defects have been shown to strongly affect the electronic properties of zigzag-GNR, inducing a continous decrease of the magnetic moments with increasing concentration of defects until the system becomes nonmagnetic for concentrations of one defect per \\(\\sim\\)10A, which might be a typical concentration for real samples.[19] Nevertheless half-metallicity induced by external electric fields seems to survive at similar defect concentrations with the same critical field strength.[16] At zigzag interfaces between C and BN domains, however, defects can change the electronic screening of the edge polarity hence affecting the effective electric potential on graphene's ribbon and destroying its intrinsic half-metallicity. It is then important to address the role played by point defects at the boundary between graphene and BN domains. In this work, first principles simulations are performed to determine the formation energies and electronic properties of intrinsic point defects (vacancies and substitutional defects) at zigzag interfaces between C and BN nanodomains that could exhibit magnetism. It is shown that these defects are energetically favored when localized close to domain interfaces, and their electronic properties are determined by the presence of a defect-induced electronic state localized at the C-N interface which could be occupied or empty depending on the donor/acceptor nature of the defect.In the context of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) structures, what is the primary effect of increased defect concentration on the magnetic moments in zigzag-edged nanoribbons?",

The energies of pure C and BN nanotubes are in agreement with values published in the literature [26; 27; 28], considering that the formation energy depends on the chirality, and increases with tube's diameter [26; 29]. The cost of removing atoms (vacancy formation) is generally larger than the energy of atom substitution (disorder), which is indicative of the high stability of the honeycomb structure. First principles calculations have shown that vacancy formation is energetically more favorable near the edge of zigzag BNNRs than in the center of the ribbon [30]. A similar effect is observed now, with defects at the edge being at least 1 eV less energetic. Interestingly, recent experiments have shown that carbon substitution (doping) in BN nanostructures is favored at the edges.

This can be seen from the DOS projected on the carbon orbitals localized at the C-N interface (shaded regions in the figure).

Small differences arise between this planar geometry and the previous tubular case, mainly because of the different C/BN ratio, but the general results are equivalent. For p-type _set N_ defects (B\\({}_{\\rm C}\\) and C\\({}_{\\rm N}\\)) the reduced number of electrons shifts the Fermi level towards lower values as we move towards higher defect concentrations (smaller supercells, from right to left), depopulating the initially fully occupied majority spin band, localized at the C-B interface (light shaded region), until the full spin polarization at the Fermi level is destroyed. On the other hand, for n-type _set B_ defects (N\\({}_{\\rm C}\\) and C\\({}_{\\rm B}\\)), the extra electrons added to the system shifts the Fermi level to higher values as we move towards higher concentrations, increasing the occupation of the C-N electronic states, and eventually destroying half-metallicity. Notice again that defects localized at the C-B interface add extra electrons that are transferred to the C-N interface, while defects localized at the C-N interface, which are electron deficient tend to remove charge from the C-B interface.Which of the following explains the change in Fermi level when the defect concentration increases for p-type substitutions in bidimensional superlattices?",

If extra electrons are added to the system, they are transferred to this electronic state and the defect would be further stabilized (in their negatively charged state), whereas electron-deficiency drains the electronic level and increases the defect formation energy. On the other hand, substitutional defects localized at the C-N interface, add one hole to the system hence lowering the Fermi level and weakIn a nitrogen-rich environment interacting with a honeycomb structure, which type of defect is more likely to act as an electron donor?",

        "question": "Recently thermoelectric materials have attracted the interest of many researchers and a lot of investigations have been performed showing that high efficiencies could indeed be obtained[1]. Among the III-VI group, the Tl-Te system is of particular interest and has been the topic of many investigations for its thermoelectric properties[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This system exists in four crystalline phases: Tl\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\), TlTe, Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\), and Tl\\({}_{2}\\)Te[8]. The Tl\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) phase is semiconducting with an energy gap of 0.68\\(\\pm\\)0.03 eV[3] and TlTe is a semimetal[2, 3, 4]. Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) has a metallic behavior and exhibits a superconducting transition at low temperature[2, 3, 5] (the electronic structure and superconductivity of Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) have been studied by Nordell and Miller[5]). The Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) structure has four crystallographic sites: Tl1 site 16l; Tl2 site 4c; Te1 site 4a and Te2 site 8h. This is a Cr\\({}_{5}\\)B\\({}_{3}\\)-prototype body centered tetragonal structure with the space group I4/mcm (140)[9]. According to B. Wolfing et al[10, 11], the three Te atoms in Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) are in the valence state Te\\({}^{2}\\), therefore the five Tl atoms have to provide six electrons. This is achieved by expanding the formula unit to Tl\\({}^{1+}\\)\\({}_{9}\\)Tl\\({}^{3+}\\)Te\\({}^{2-}\\)\\({}_{6}\\), where the 4c site, which accommodates two Tl atoms per expanded formula unit, is equally occupied by Tl\\({}^{+}\\) and Tl\\({}^{3+}\\). Thus, the Tl\\({}^{3+}\\) can be substituted with the trivalent elements Bi\\({}^{3+}\\) and Sb\\({}^{3+}\\), resulting in the compounds BiTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\) and SbTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\). Some studies have already been performed on BiTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\)[10, 11, 12] and SbTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\)[11] due to their excellent thermoelectric properties and this explains why these compounds are the topic of the present study. Nevertheless thallium is a toxic element which can not be used directly in thermoelectric materials.

The calculations employed the Perdew-Bucke-Ernzerhof (PBE)[17] exchange-correlation functional in the GGA. For the PAW calculations we use potentials with 15 valence electrons for Bi (5d\\({}^{10}\\)6s\\({}^{2}\\)6p\\({}^{3}\\)), 5 for Sb(5s\\({}^{2}\\)5p\\({}^{3}\\)), 13 for Tl (5d\\({}^{10}\\)6s\\({}^{2}\\)6p\\({}^{1}\\)) and 4 for Te(5s\\({}^{2}\\)5p\\({}^{4}\\)), and a plane-wave energy cutoff of 300 eV is held constant for all the calculations. Brillouin zone integrations are performed using Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes[18], with a k-point sampling of 11x11x11 for the three compounds and the tetrahedron method with Blochl correction[19] is used in the present calculations. The Methfessel-Paxton technique[20] with a smearing parameter of 0.2 eV is also used. The total energy is converged numerically to less than 1\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-6}\\) eV/unit. After structural optimization, calculated forces are converged to less than 0.01eV/A. As mentioned in our previous work[21], the Vinet[22] equation of state is used in this work to obtain the equilibrium volume (\\(\\Omega_{0}\\)), and the total energy (E).

        "question": "We represent in Fig.1 the total density of states of the three compounds with and without SOC. As shown in Fig.1, whereas Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) is metallic, the substituted compounds become semiconducting which _a priori_ is favorable for thermoelectricity[1].

The SOC calculated band gap of BiTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\) is equal to 0.26 eV (0.58 eV without SOC) and the one of SbTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\) is equal to 0.37 eV (0.54 eV without SOC).

Also, it should be noted that at the \\(\\Gamma\\) point, without SOC, the bandgap is only slightly larger than the indirect bandgap (0.62 eV), whereas with SOC the bandgap is equal to 0.49 eV, which is roughly 2 times larger than the indirect bandgap. Thus, the inclusion of the SOC is crucial to obtain a good description of the band structure at the vicinity of the Fermi level, as it has also been shown in other semiconductors containing heavy elements as like Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te[28, 29]. In that case, as in our case, the effect of the SOC is double: it broadens the lowest conduction bands and hence reduces the size of the bandgap and it changes the position of the valence and conduction bands extrema as we will see later.What impact does Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) have on the band gap and conduction bands in heavy element semiconductors, like those containing bismuth (Bi)?",

From Fig. 4 (b) the significant redistribution of the bonding charge between Bi and the Te atoms indicates the occurrence of a new strong iono-covalent bonding with the symmetry breaking of the \"horseshoe\" arrangement.

        "question": "In the case of the doped samples, the Mott's law which is _a priori_ only valid for metals can also be applied to determine the thermopower of semiconductors since the doped compounds are both degenerate semiconductors. This can be seen from the experimental reports in which metallic behaviours were reported for the electrical transport[10, 11]. To determine the thermopower, we have used the rigid band model (RBM)[34] knowing the concentration of charge carriers and then we have applied Mott's law : this is a rough approximation but the aim is to check if this crude method can at least give some hints on the thermoelectric properties of the alloys. When the DOS is changing smoothly then the RBM is working. Conversely, in presence of some van Hove singularities or if the DOS is changing rapidly, the RBM does not work, as in the case of the pure Tl\\({}_{5}\\)Te\\({}_{5}\\) compound. We can apply this method to the Bismuth and Antimony doped compound since no more than two bands contribute to the electronic transport and because of the absence of van Hove singularities. In addition we know that at 300K the hole concentrations are respectively 1.7 10\\({}^{19}\\) cm\\({}^{-3}\\) and 1.5 10\\({}^{20}\\) cm\\({}^{-3}\\) from experiments[10, 11]. So we apply the rigid band model and lower the Fermi level on the DOS of Fig.1 until we reach the correct carrier concentration. Finally we apply Eq. (2) and obtain a thermopower at 300K of 163 \\(\\mu\\)V/K for BiTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\) and of 200 \\(\\mu\\)V/K for SbTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\). This is coherent with the experimental values of 260 \\(\\mu\\)V/K found for BiTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\) and of 120 \\(\\mu\\)V/K for SbTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\)[10, 11]. However, we do not find the experimental tendency and therefore some improvements are necessary to reproduce quantitatively the experiments. We note that Yamanaka et al. found a thermopower very close to our results (160 \\(\\mu\\)V/K)[35] but unfortunately the charge carriers in their samples are not known (it is worth noting that including the SOC gives a better agreement with experiments. Indeed without SOC, we find a thermopower at 300K of 137 \\(\\mu\\)V/K for BiTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\) and of 82 uV/K for SbTl\\({}_{9}\\)Te\\({}_{6}\\)).Which of the following conditions signifies the effective application of the rigid band model (RBM) in determining the thermoelectric properties of doped semiconductor compounds?",

However, observed abundances of C\\({}_{60}\\) challenge the standard ion-molecule or grain-surface chemistry formation routes, which build up molecules from small to large in the interstellar medium.

        "question": "Earlier _Spitzer_ observations of the NGC 7023 reflection nebula have revealed a chemical evolution of PAHs: deep in the cloud, emission is dominated by PAH clusters, which evaporate into free-flying PAHs when exposed to the UV radiation from the star [14, 15, 16]. There, gaseous PAHs are, in turn, ionized. While the neutral PAHs are dominated by zig-zag edges - as demonstrated by the strong C-H solo out-of-plane modes -, the ions have an arm-chair molecular structure, characterized by strong duo out-of-plane modes [17]. In regions closest to the star, the presence of C\\({}_{60}\\) in the neutral state is evidenced by _Spitzer_ observations (Fig. 1). New _Herschel_ observations provide a measurement of dust emission in the same region, at high angular resolution (Fig. 1). This measurement can be used to derive the integrated intensity radiated by the nebula which can be used as a calibrator, to convert the _Spitzer_ observations of the PAHs and C\\({}_{60}\\) bands into absolute chemical abundances of these species, allowing a quantitive study of PAH and C\\({}_{60}\\) chemical evolution.Based on the concepts of photodissociation regions (PDRs) in astronomy, which of the following best describes the evolutionary process of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within a reflection nebula when exposed to varying degrees of UV radiation?",

        "question": "The integrated intensity of PAH emission, \\(I_{PAH}\\), is measured by fitting a PAH emission model to the observed _Spitzer_ mid infrared low resolution spectrum. This data covers the 5 to 14 \\(\\mu\\)m range where most of the emission occurs. Because this spectral range contains the emission due to the vibration of both C-C and C-H bonds, it is insensitive to ionization of PAHs. An example of this fitting model is presented in [24]. This tool provides the integrated intensity in the PAH bands as an output and takes care of continuum subtraction and extinction correction. The C\\({}_{60}\\) integrated intensity (\\(I_{C_{60}}\\)) extraction needs to be done separately for each band. We first measure the integrated intensity in the 19 and 17.4 band. The first step consists in extracting the intensity in the 19.0 \\(\\mu\\)m band (\\(I_{19.0}\\)) by fitting a gaussian and subtracting a local linear continuum. The 17.4 \\(\\mu\\)m band is contaminated by PAH emission, but this can be removed effectively. The contribution of PAHs to the 17.4 band can be estimated in this way: in the outer regions of the nebula, the 17.4 \\(\\mu\\)m band is 100% due to PAHs (since no C\\({}_{60}\\) is detected there) and so is the 16.4 \\(\\mu\\)m band. The 16.4 and 17.4 \\(\\mu\\)m band of PAHs are known to correlate. Indeed, in the outer regions of the nebula we find \\(I_{17.4}^{PAH}\\sim I_{16.4}\\times 0.35\\). Therefore, over the whole nebula, we can estimate the intensity of the 17.4 \\(\\mu\\)m band due to C\\({}_{60}\\) by \\(I_{17.4}^{C_{60}}\\sim I_{17.4}-I_{16.4}\\times 0.35\\). Figure S2 shows the result of this process on the map. The 7.0 \\(\\mu\\)m band is faint and usually hard to detect. In the regions closest to the star where both the 19 and 7.0 \\(\\mu\\)m features are observed, we can calibrate the ratio of \\(I_{19.0}/I_{7.0}\\). It is found to be relatively stable (at least in this small zone close to the star) and of the order of 0.4. Therefore we use \\(I_{7.0}=0.4\\times I_{19.0}\\). The 8.5 \\(\\mu\\)m band is undetectable because of the strong PAH band present at 8.6 \\(\\mu\\)m, so we use the ratio provided in [3] for 5 eV photons that is \\(I_{8.5}=0.4\\times I_{19.0}\\). The total C\\({}_{60}\\) IR emission is hence given by \\(I_{C_{60}}=I_{19.0}+I_{17.4}-I_{16.4}\\times 0.35+I_{19.0}\\times 0.4+I_{19.0} \\times 0.4\\).In infrared spectroscopy, which method is employed to determine the integrated intensity of a band that is contaminated by overlapping emission from similar molecules?",

        "question": "Our models reveal that 70 C atoms PAH become unstable to graphene formation in the studied region of NGC 7023. Much larger PAHs will survive closer to the star, while smaller PAHs will rapidly be completely dehydrogenated further away but - because of size - this will not lead to the formation of fullerenes. As shown in laboratory experiments [19], graphene sheets larger than about 70 C atoms can be transformed into fullerene, but in space this is driven by UV photons rather than energetic electrons. We surmise that fullerene formation is initiated by single C atom loss [40] at the zig-zag edge of the graphene flake. Quantum chemical calculations indeed show that the armchair structure of graphene clusters stabilizes through in plane \\(\\pi\\)-bond formation, while the open-shell orbitals associated with the dangling bonds are located at the zig-zag edge [38], making these atoms more labile [19]. A detailed study of graphene edge structure [39], based on experimental results [40], has indeed shown that single C atom loss leads to the formation of reconstructed edges bearing pentagons. These defects dramatically stress graphene flakes, inducing significantpositive curvature in its topology [32]. Eventually, the barrier-less migration of the pentagons within the hexagonal network will lead to the zipping-up of the flake into C\\({}_{60}\\) ([19], Fig. 3). The above mechanism is severely limited by the physical conditions, controlling dehydrogenation, and the size of the precursors, which need to be above \\(\\sim 70\\) C atoms. As shown by our observations, only about 1% of the available PAHs are converted into C\\({}_{60}\\) by this process (Fig. 2). The activation of this \"top-down\" chemistry requires the high UV fields available near massive stars. As a corollary, high abundance of C\\({}_{60}\\) in the diffuse interstellar medium [41] reflects processing by massive stars, which are capable of dehydrogenating PAHs in the relevant size range (60-70 C atoms). PAHs much larger than than 70 C atoms will survive even in close encounters with massive stars. Smaller size PAHs ( \\(<50\\) C atoms) cannot reach the fullerene island of stability, hence their photo-processing (Fig. 2) must be a source various carbon nano-compounds e.g. rings, chains, cages, bowls, tubes etc ( Fig. 3). Laboratory experiments have indeed shown that processing of small graphene constrictions can lead to carbon rings and chains [42]. Finally, we note that recent studies suggest that PAH molecules do not provide a satisfactory explanation to the diffuse interstellar bands [44, 43]. The compounds described in this top-down chemistry may be relevant to understand these features of the UV extinction curve, in the Milky-Way and in other galaxies [45].In interstellar environments, what attribute of graphene clusters is critical to their ability to transform into fullerenes through UV photon-driven processes?",

        "question": "The experimental realization of graphene by mechanical exfoliation of graphite on SiO\\({}_{2}\\) surfaces [1] has triggered a revolution in the design of electronic devices [2; 3] and chemical sensors [4; 5] because of the unique electronic properties [6-8] of graphene and its high sensitivity to the electrochemical environment [9]. Because of this high sensitivity, the electronic properties of graphene are strongly affected by substrate charged impurities [10; 11] leading to a large device-to-device variation in performance [11]. The charged impurities present in the substrate create an inhomogeneous electrostatic potential landscape [12; 13] with a typical length scale of tens of nanometers. These potential fluctuations cause a position dependent Dirac point on the graphene layer, producing spatial carrier density variations referred to in the literature as electron-hole puddles [14; 15].Which of the following factors primarily influences the variation in electronic properties and device performance in graphene-based electronic devices?",

It has been shown that the presence of charges on a substrate can be detected by measuring the local tip-sample interaction [40; 41]. The AFM capability of our combined STM/AFM has been used to measure the tip-sample interaction, simultaneously with the STM topography, using the frequency modulation AFM mode [42]. The topography and the tip-sample interaction simultaneously measured on top of the single graphene layer can be seen in Figure 3a and 3b respectively. Charged impurities in the substrate, which cause an attractive electrostatic interaction between tip and sample, appear as dark dips in Figure 2b. When comparing both images in Figure 3 it can be clearly observed that a bright hillock in the apparent topography of the sample is frequently accompanied by such a dip in the tip-sample interaction (see the arrows in Figures 3a and 3b). To quantify this similarity between the two images we calculate their normalized cross correlation (Figure 3c) which shows a minimum at the origin with a value of -0.7 with a Full Width at Half Minimum (FWHM) of 10 nm. The presence of such a narrow and prominent negative peak at the origin of this plot implies a strong anti-correlation between Figure 3a and 3b.

The \\(\\beta\\) image shows a low average value (\\(5.2\\pm 0.4\\) nm\\({}^{-1}\\)), typical of STM operation in air [47], and localized inhomogeneities (identified as dips in the \\(\\beta\\) image) caused by local doping induced by negative charged impurities (Figure 5c). Considering that each dip in the \\(\\beta\\) image is due to the presence of one individual negative charge we can estimate the density of charged impurities by tentatively counting the number of depressions in a given area, resulting in an impurity density \\(\\sigma=(2.9\\pm 0.6)\\cdot 10^{11}\\) cm\\({}^{-2}\\). A more objective procedure to statistically analyze the short-range ordering [48] and spatial variation of \\(\\beta\\) is to obtain the radially-averaged autocorrelation function \\(g(r)\\), shown in Figure 5c. The typical radius \\(r_{\\text{FWHM}}\\) at half minimum of the localized inhomogeneities is obtained from the radial distance at which the value of \\(g(r)\\) is \\(0.5\\), which yields \\(r_{\\text{FWHM}}=4.7\\pm 1.1\\) nm.

We have employed a combined STM/AFM which allows for simultaneous measurement of sample topography, tip-sample electrostatic forces and tunneling current decay constant and to study their correlation. The sign and density of the substrate charged impurities have been obtained from the measurement of the contact potential difference of graphene using electrostatic force microscopy, but this operation mode does not provide enough lateral resolution to probe the effect of an individual charged impurity on the electronic properties of graphene. We have found that the tunneling current exponential decay constant, related to the local tunneling barrier height, is very sensitive to the presence of subsurface charges and is spatially inhomogeneous. Consequently the apparent topography measured in constant current STM images is not only related to the roughness of graphene but also dependent on the spatial distortions of the electronic structure of graphene. The local tunneling decay constant image shows a distribution of localized inhomogeneities which are related to the presence of negative subsurface charges. In the studied samples these inhomogeneities do not show long-range ordering and their average spacing is 22 nm with an average radius of 5 nm. The average charge density obtained from the electrostatic force microscopy measurements is consistent with the charge density that can be obtained by counting the number of spots in the graphene layer where its local tunneling barrier height is strongly distorted. Such local tunneling decay constant measurements are robust making them attractive for high resolution microscopic characterization of graphene devices.In the context of probing the local electronic properties of graphene, which technique allows for high-resolution mapping of subsurface charged impurities' effects through measurements of tunneling current decay constants?",

        "question": "Recent progress towards a realistic description of correlated systems is the combination of LDA with DMFT [30] (LDA+DMFT). While this approach has proven to be quite successful for the description of spectral properties of transition metal oxides [2; 31; 32; 33; 34; 35; 36; 37; 38] and the newly discovered iron-based superconductors [39; 40; 41], effects originating from spatial fluctuations remain inconclusive. Attempts to include short-range spatial fluctuations have been done in the context of the spin-Peierls system TiOCl -where pairing correlations are important- within an N\\({}^{th}\\) order muffin tin orbital (NMTO) approach combined with DCA [42] as well as NMTO combined with a variational cluster approach (VCA) [43]. In this work, we present an alternative approach where we extend a newly developed implementation of the LDA+DMFT approach [31] in the context of the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) [44] method by including spatial fluctuations within DCA (LDA+DCA), and we investigate the spectral properties of SrVO\\({}_{3}\\) as a test case.Which approach has been used to study the spectral properties of materials, combining density functional theory with dynamic mean-field theory and attempting to include spatial fluctuations?",

The new features obtained in LDA+DCA are a broad peak around 1.5 eV and a coherent peak around 0.2 eV below \\(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\). LDA results (see Fig. 2(b)) as well as most former LDA+DMFT results (see also Fig. 2 (a)) don't exhibit neither a broad peak nor a clear coherent peak below \\(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\). Recent angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments [53], have observed, in fact, a broad peak around 1.5 eV and a coherent peak around 0.4 eV below \\(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\) (Fig. 3(b) in Ref.

Over the last three years extensive studies have been conducted on the Fe based systems and the results have been reviewed in recent articles (See Ref. [2]). In the RFeAsO\\({}_{1\\text{-x}}\\)F\\({}_{\\text{x}}\\) (R=rare earth) 1111- type system, optimization of the chemical properties led to the realization of a superconducting transition temperature of \\(\\sim\\)55 K in SmFeAsO\\({}_{1\\text{-}8}\\)[3], the highest in these new iron systems to date. This first class of materials possesses normal state resistivity values near the transition temperature which are less than 1 m\\(\\Omega\\).cm with linear behavior at higher temperatures. Following this, superconductivity was discovered in the system AFe\\({}_{2}\\)As\\({}_{2}\\) system (A=K, Se, Ba, called the 122 system) [4] with an ambient pressure transition temperature, Tc \\(\\sim\\)38 K, and resistivity near the transition temperature is \\(\\sim\\)1 m\\(\\Omega\\).cm. Another class of materials referred to as the 111 type (with CuSb\\({}_{2}\\) structure), LiFeAs, was observed to superconduct with a transition near \\(\\sim\\)18 K [5]. More recently, the PbO type system such as FeSe\\({}_{1\\text{-x}}\\) (with defects on the Fe and Se sites) as well as the Te alloys of this system were found to exhibit superconductivity with Tc near 8 K at ambient temperature for FeSe\\({}_{1\\text{-x}}\\)[6]. Tc was found to be optimized near \\(\\sim\\)37 K for an external pressure of \\(\\sim\\)7 GPa [7]. In this system the resistivity values just above the onset of superconductivity are also \\(\\sim\\)1 m\\(\\Omega\\).cm and linear behavior is exhibited above Tc.Which material class had the highest reported superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in iron arsenide (pnictide) systems, and under what conditions was this Tc observed?",

In Fig. 3(b) we see the structure function for the local structure with respect to the Se sites. The first peak, composed only of Se-Fe bonds, is a close match with the qualitative model and the data show that the Fe-Se bonds have a low level of disorder. The second shell about Se corresponds to the Se-K bond and in this region there is negligible amplitude. This indicates a very high level of disorder in the K layers which will be seen in the K K-edge measurements. Near the Se-Se shell some non negligible amplitude is present while none exists for the Se-Fe peak.In analyzing local structural properties of materials, which observation might indicate a significant level of disorder in one of the atomic shells in the context of bond analysis?",

The small Fermi energy causes a saturation of spin polarization of carrier spins and some other new effects [5].In the context of the RKKY interaction, what key factor differentiates its effect in diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors compared to classical metallic ferromagnets?",

None of them, however, can be attributed to any magnetic resonance already observed in similar systems [10-12]. Up till now, none of them is satisfactorily explained. In particular, ferromagnetic resonance in the semi-insulating (Ga,Mn)As is characterized by the resonance frequency which matches precisely the manganese spins' resonance frequency. The absence of any influence of the hole spins remains unexplained. The resonance in the semi-metallic (Ga,Mn)As is of a very different character. It is characterized by a large anisotropy, a complex structure which can be attributed to the spin wave resonance and \\(g\\)-factor considerably different from that corresponding to the \\(g\\)-factor of the Mn spins. These properties allow to conclude that the resonance corresponds to the ferromagnetic mode of the ferrimagnetic resonance [8, 9]. It suggests that the carrier spins are ordered and form a macroscopic magnetic moment. Till now that problem has not been considered by any theoretical model. The exchange correction within the Fermi liquid approach is the only effect discussed by Dietl et al. [3, 4].

For the whole range of \\(\\Delta\\), the longitudinal component of the exchange field, \\(\\Xi_{\\rm zz}\\), is bigger than the transverse one, \\(\\Xi_{\\rm xx}\\). It means that the magnetization of the local spin has the tendency to be oriented parallel to the \\(z\\) direction, as defined by the magnetization of the carrier spins. This tendency vanishes with vanishing \\(\\Delta\\). Apart from the listed dependencies of the contributions on the spin splitting, we see the onset of the magnetization-induced anisotropy. The anisotropy, \\(D=\\Xi_{\\rm zz}\\) - \\(\\Xi_{\\rm xx}\\), corresponds to the magnetization-induced anisotropy. The coupling between the local spins evolves with \\(\\Delta\\), from the pure Heisenberg coupling for \\(\\Delta\\!=\\!0\\), via anisotropic to the Ising coupling in the large \\(\\Delta\\) limit, where the transverse component vanishes. In this regime, the exchange field, as seen by a random local spin, is parallel to the electron gas magnetization.

The both models, Zener and RKKY neglect the transverse components. However, the Zener approach explains the lack of influence of the perpendicular components by the postulated averaging of the perpendicular spin components (random phases of spin precession), while the lack of the transverse component of RKKY exchange is the consequence of the half-metal character and the large spin splitting of the carrier band.In a scenario where the spin splitting parameter \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) approaches zero, which of the following accurately describes the behavior of the local spin magnetization and its coupling characteristics?",

        "question": "The zero field splitting of spin subbands occurs only in semiconductor structures with sufficiently low symmetry. In general, one distinguishes between the Dresselhaus field [15] and the Rashba field [16, 17]. Spin splitting is equivalent to an effective spin-orbit field. The Dresselhaus field is the consequence of the lack of the crystal inversion symmetry. It occurs, e.g., in zinc blend structure, i.e., in all II-VI and III-V semiconductor compounds but it is forbidden by symmetry conditions in bulk silicon. The Bychkov-Rashba field is a consequence of the lack of the mirror symmetry in 2D structures. It occurs also in silicon 2D structures. The direction of the spin-orbit field, \\(H_{so}\\), is perpendicular to carrier \\(k\\)-vector. In the case of Bychkov-Rashba field it is in-plane oriented. Generally the inversion of the \\(k\\)-vector direction leads to inversion of \\(H_{so}\\). As a consequence, in thermal equilibrium the sum of all spin-orbit fields acting on the carrier system vanishes. It follows that most of the spintronic (dependent on both magnetic and electrical properties) effects vanish in the thermal equilibrium, too. Therefore, we need to search for phenomena engaging both the spin and electron properties only in the systems in thermodynamic nonequilibrium. Below we shall review the class of spin effects induced by electron current, namely spin Hall, spin manipulation by electrical current, and the class of spin footvoltaic effects.Which phenomenon can be observed only in semiconductor structures with broken crystal inversion symmetry?",

        "question": "When an electrical current is applied and the Fermi sphere is moved from the center, the total spin-orbit field acting on the ensemble of the electron spins is not anymore zero. The electron spins begin the precession and a tendency to create additional spin polarization appears. Both effects are diminished by spin relaxation. However, when the frequency of RF current is much higher than the spin relaxation rate, the spin polarization is not affected by electrical current and the effective RF magnetic field is the main consequence of the current. As it was demonstrated by Wilamowski and Jantsch [18], such SO field can play the role of microwave magnetic field leading to an additional resonance absorption. As a consequence three different ESR signals are observed in 2D electron gas: a classic absorption caused by the magnetic component of microwave field, SO field caused by the electrical current and an additional, so-called polarization signal, resulting from the change of electrical conductivity under resonance condition. This effect reflects the dependence of the conductivity of the high mobility 2D electrons on spin polarization and allows for electrical measurement of spin structure.In a high mobility 2D electron gas, what are the three different types of ESR signals that can be observed under resonance conditions?",

        "question": "Positive charge on carbon atoms around nitrogen has been considered to be a possible reason for the high performance of catalytic activities.[3, 41] However, we note that both graphite-like and pyridine-like nitrogen get electron from carbon, but their catalysis abilities are very different. This should be understood from more detailed electronic structures. Graphite-like nitrogen has two p\\({}_{x}\\) electrons. Therefore, \\(\\pi\\)* anti-bonding orbitals around nitrogen will be partially occupied, which may provide efficient active sites. However, for pyridine-like nitrogen, the situation is different. There is a lone pair on nitrogen, and only one electron for the p\\({}_{x}\\) orbital. Occupation in \\(\\pi\\)* anti-bonding orbital is thus expected to be negligible.

In Fig. 4e, there are two sharp peaks at the energy -0.50 and -0.76 eV with a nitrogen \\(p\\) character. They are nitrogen lone pair electrons. At the same time, there is a new energy band formed in the energy gap compared to pristine SWCNT (Fig. 5e). This is the defect band due to the pyridine-like nitrogen doping. With a C vacancy among the three nitrogen atoms (Fig. 3d), the system becomes one \\(\\pi\\) electron less, which forms a 'hole' doping. For the other nitrogen-doped SWCNTs, there is no lone pair electron peaks in their DOS. In these system, there is one more \\(\\pi\\)* electron from nitrogen, forming n-type doping.

All kinds of the nitrogen-doping lower work function. Typically, higher energy electrons have stronger reducing power. Therefore, nitrogen-doped SWCNTs show high efficient oxygen reduction ability. The pyridine-like nitrogen doping has the least Fermi energy level shift, thus lower catalysis ability. However, we also note that the high efficient Stone-Wales defect nitrogen-doping doesn't have the very high Fermi energy. In this case, the large adsorption energy of the intermediate state may have made an important role. Based on these analyses, we expect that the pyrrole-like nitrogen may also show a great catalytic activity for ORRs, as it has pentagon ring and a coordination number of there.\n\n\\begin{table}Which of the following factors primarily contributes to the oxygen reduction ability of nitrogen-doped SWCNTs?",

Such a gradient is often induced by radiation, therefore the effect is called photophoresis [7].

Gas molecules colliding with the particle surface, accomodate to the local temperature and leave with a thermal velocity according to the surface temperature. From this a net momentum on the particle results. A detailed theory for thermophoresis and photophoresis exist for spherical particles [6; 7; 8; 9]. Many parameters within this theory are not easily accessible for calculations, i.e. the absorption and heat transfer within the particle or the accomodation coefficient are needed which are physical problems of their own. In reality particles are also far away from being perfect spheres with well defined sizes (see also Fig.2) and correction factors have to be applied. These are currently unknown. If thermophoretic and photophoretic forces are directed upwards they might offset gravity and lead to the levitation of particles. In such a stable case the forces can directly be modelled and the particle can be subjected to further research. To provide stable levitation the lifting phoretic forces have to decrease with height and a sideward confining force is needed to prevent a sideward drift. We also considered convection but convection is too slow in our case and is not important for the trapping principle. However, gas drag is providing damping for a particle trajectory and rotation and allows to determine aerodynamical properties.What is a critical challenge in accurately calculating thermophoretic and photophoretic forces for levitating particles?",

The cold bottom of a container filled with liquid nitrogen (\\(T_{1}\\simeq 77\\) K) is located 25 mm above the peltier element. The chamber is evacuated to pressures between \\(0.1-10\\) mbar. Ice particles are ejected spontaneously from the ice surface at mbar pressure. This might be due to the photophoretic ejection mechanism discussed in [10] and [11]. After the particles are ejected, in general two different types of particle trajectories are observed (Fig.3). Most particles continuously rise with their velocity varying with height. They are decelerated in the lower part of their trajectory but are accelerated once they reach a certain height. The other fraction of particles comes to rest about half the way between bottom and top and is trapped for at least a few minutes. Tens of particles can be trapped at the same time. The sizes of the levitated particles roughly vary between 10 and 100 \\(\\mu\\)m. The lower limit is set by the resolution of the camera. A minor fraction of particles fall back to the snow surface. Most levitating particles rotate about the vertical axis [12].In a vacuum chamber experiment, what likely mechanism causes ice particles to be spontaneously ejected from the ice surface when exposed to certain mbar pressures?",

While thermophoresis directly depends on the temperature gradient between the peltier element and the nitrogen container, photophoresis is induced by the thermal radiation \\(I=\\sigma T^{4}\\) of the peltier element and - once rising - by the surrounding warm chamber (293 K). The higher the particle ascends within the gap between the peltier element and the nitrogen container the more dominant is the ambient thermal radiation. Hence photophoresis gets stronger with height \\(z\\). We simulated the gas flow and temperature distribution within the chamber using a commercial software (Comsol Multiphysics 4). Fig.4 shows the temperature distribution and Fig.5 depicts the temperature gradient from the warm vacuum chamber walls towards the center of the chamber at half the way between the peltier element and the nitrogen container.\n\nThe thermophoretic force for a spherical particleWhich of the following effects becomes more pronounced as a particle ascends within a gap and is influenced by thermal radiation proportional to the fourth power of temperature?",

We will discuss this more in detail in the next section. Our results are, in some aspects, different from the ones suggested by the two citedworks. Indeed we found that, while vacancies does not repel, the configuration suggested as most favorable for the (T) structure by Ostanin et al.[9], is not the lowest in energy. Indeed, surprisingly, the latter comes out to be unstable, with one of the two vacancies which changes position if we let the system relax (Fig. 3). This last result suggests that, in presence of vacancies, oxygen atoms can move with (nearly) no potential barrier to overcome. This is a theoretical evidence that YSZ is a good ionic conductor. Indeed this property is important for many applications and has been investigated in other works[30].In a theoretical investigation of ionic conductors, what is the significance of a configuration where di-vacancy complexes induce oscillations in both the exchange-correlation and mean field energies, leading one of the two vacancies to change position if the system is allowed to relax?",

In the case of electric spin injection from ferromagnetic metal to non-magnetic metal, the spin relaxation torque was shown to be proportional to \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the applied electric field) and the spin injection effect is explained based on the behavior of spin relaxation torque at the interface [10].

        "question": "Let us look in detail into the spin relaxation torque of eq. (20) for a junction of two nonmagnetic metals shown in Fig. 3 (a). As seen from eq. (20), the RSOF at the interface needs to form a vector chirality (\\(\\mathbf{E}_{\\rm SO}\\times\\partial\\mathbf{E}_{\\rm SO}\\)) to induce finite spin relaxation torque. Such configuration is expected to arise generally when the junction is of finite area. Since the Rashba effect is due to the structure-inversion-symmetry breaking of a quantum well and the RSOF arises from the gradient of a scalar potential, the RSOF will behave near the edges as shown in Fig. 3 (b). Let us consider a square junction area in the \\(xy\\) plane with an applied electric field (or current) along the \\(y\\) direction. Then both the first and the second terms of the right-hand side of eq. (20) have only the component with \\(\\alpha=x\\). The sign of the relaxation torque is negative along the \\(x\\) direction and positive along \\(y\\) direction, resulting in the torque density distribution of Figs. 3 (e) and 3 (f) with the spin sink along the \\(x\\) axis and spin source along the \\(y\\) axis. In the static case, the spin current generated by the present torque density is polarized in the \\(x\\) direction and satisfies \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{j}_{x}^{x}={\\cal T}^{x}\\). In the analogy with the Gauss's law of the classical electromagnetism, the generated-spin-current distribution is as depicted in Figs. 3 (c), 3 (d) and 3 (g). Since the induced torque comes from the vector chirality of the RSOF, the spin-current distribution generated by the spin relaxation torque is the same for the opposite sides of the system,What is the role of vector chirality in inducing spin relaxation torque at the interface of two nonmagnetic metals?",

We found that the spin relaxation torque depends quantitatively on whether an external electric field is applied or not and on the spin polarization of the carrier. In the case of non-magnets, there exist equilibrium spin currents induced by vector chirality of RSOF in the absence of an external field. In the presence of an external field, on the other hand, spin relaxation torque arises from the coupling of the electric field and vector chirality of RSOF.

        "question": "Our results for graphene and silicene along with other relevant information are given in Table 1. As expected, our computed values of \"a\" for silicene are larger than those of graphene because of larger ionic radius of Si compared to that of C. Also, because of the well-known over binding of the LDA, the GGA-PBE result is larger than the one for LDA. Further, for a graphite monolayerthe calculated value of \"a\" \\(\\approx\\) 2.445 A is smaller (contracted by 0.6 %) than the experimental value(s) for bulk graphite [22; 23]. It is an experimental fact that the in-plane thermal expansion coefficient of graphite is negative below about 400\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C [15; 24]. The explanation [15; 24] that this effect is due to a lateral contraction arising out of the thermal stretching of the crystal along the \"c\" axis, implies that a monolayer should also exhibit contraction. The in-plane contraction for graphite and hex-Si monolayer are depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively, which are obtained by calculating \"a\" by varying \"c\"; the insets show variation of \"a\" vs \"1/c\"; the contracted values of \"a\" are listed in Table 1. The value of \"a\" corresponding to c = \\(\\infty\\), obtained by linear fit of the data set (a, 1/c), may be regarded as a lower bound on \"a\" for the 2D hexagonal structure under study within the present method. Further, our results for graphite monolayer correctly yield the small contraction of \"a\" as observed experimentally. This contraction is also predicated for a monolayer of hex-Si as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Given this contraction arising out of the value of the \"c\" parameter used, and basic differences between different other methods, the deviations of our results with others are reasonable.Which of the following explanations best describes the observed contraction in the in-plane thermal expansion coefficient for a monolayer of graphite at high temperatures?",

This is the property of the so called Dirac-cone [2; 3] in graphene that is mostly responsible for its unusual exotic property. It is to be noted that this graphene-like electronic structure of 2D hex-Si has recently been predicted theoretically for planar structure (buckling parameter \\(\\Delta\\) = 0.0 A) in [8] and for buckled structure (\\(\\Delta\\) \\(\\approx\\) 0.44 A) in [9; 10], using different methods.

        "question": "where the \\(\\beta\\) is nearly unchanged with temperature (see inset of fig. 6). The \\(1/T_{1}\\) thus obtained is plotted in fig. 6. The faster relaxation rate for the nano sample must then arise from fluctuating paramagnetic moments at Sn sites. A distribution in the value of such magnetic moments (higher near the surface, smaller in the core, and perhaps grain size dependent) then leads to a distribution of \\(T_{1}\\). Note that the longest \\(T_{1}\\) component as obtained from the slope of the data (at 300 K for the nano sample) at high-\\(t\\) in fig. 5 is about 80 s which is still less than half the value for the bulk. For a paramagnet, the spin-lattice relaxation rate is expected to be nearly \\(T\\)-independent at high-\\(T\\) and might increase a little with a decrease in temperature. The decrease in \\(1/T_{1}\\) seen by us points to a gap in the spin excitation spectrum of the local moments. This might be connected to some novel mechanism (such as orbital magnetism) for the formation of these moments. There is a possibility that phonon excitation spectra and the coupling of the nuclei to the phonon bath get strongly modified in nanoparticles and are still effective in \\(1/T_{1}\\). However, it seems unlikely that there are only ferromagnetic and diamagnetic regions in the sample without any paramagnetic ones. A theoretical effort is needed to understand better the phonons as also the dynamical susceptibility of defect induced moments in nanoparticles.In the context of spin-lattice relaxation rates in paramagnetic materials, which of the following scenarios best explains a non-uniform distribution of relaxation times in nano-sized samples compared to bulk samples?",
