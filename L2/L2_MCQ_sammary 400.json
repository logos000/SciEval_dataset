        "question": "Isolated GNFs and GNRs can be presently produced using different experimental approaches. The bottom-up approach by thermal annealing nanographene molecules results in a conductive graphene film.[4] Alternatively, nanographene can be produced by soft-landing of ions generated by solvent-free matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation.[6] The product is transfered to the gas phase, purified and adsorbed at surfaces. As top-down-techniques, GNRs with widths varying from several tens of nanometers down to 2 nm have been fabricated either by etching[7; 8; 9] or by means of chemical treatment of graphene or graphite.[2] It has been reported that GNRs with certain edge chirality would open the band gap.[10]Which of the following best summarizes the various methods used to produce isolated graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) mentioned in the text?",

        "question": "Torsional oscillator anomalies were first interpreted as the mass decoupling of a certain supersolid fraction,[5; 6] a counterintuitive physical phenomenon that Andreev and Lifshitz already proposed in solid helium more than 40 years ago.[7] Supporting this view is the fact that TO anomalies appear to occur only in bulk \\({}^{4}\\)He.[8] Nevertheless, the supersolid interpretation of TO anomalies appears to leave open its connection to SM fluctuations and diverse theoretical arguments and hypotheses have been put forward in an attempt to simultaneously rationalize the origins of both anomalies. Anderson, for example, proposes that supersolidity is an intrinsic property of bosonic crystals, which is only enhanced by disorder, and that the elastic anomaly is due to the generation of vortices at temperatures close to the supersolid transition.[9] From a diametrically opposite standpoint, Reppy has argued that the TO behavior is caused by an increase of the \\({}^{4}\\)He shear modulus which mimics mass decoupling by stiffening the TO setup.[10] Other scenarios somewhat more reconciling with the original TO and SM interpretations have been also proposed in which for instance mass superflow is assumed to occur in the core of dislocations only when these are static.[4; 11]Which of the following best summarizes the discussion surrounding torsional oscillator anomalies in solid helium?",

This result seems to show that NCRI can be totally attributed to elastic effects and not to the existence of a supersolid fraction.[13] On the other hand, a recent experiment in which DC rotation was superposed to both TO and SM measures suggested that the cause of both anomalies below a critical temperature could have different microscopic origins.[14] Also, the source of a small peak in the specific heat of \\({}^{4}\\)He[15] at temperatures close to that at which TO and SM anomalies appear remains yet unexplained.Which statement best summarizes the current state of understanding regarding the anomalies observed in SM and TO in solid helium-4?",

The same can be concluded about the \\(T=0\\) Debye temperature for which, as we show in Fig. 4, the corresponding C-to-IC variation is smaller than the typical experimental precision.

        "question": "To summarize, we have studied the elastic properties of hcp solid \\({}^{4}\\)He in a metastable IC state and compared them to those obtained for its C ground-state. Our calculations show that near melting elastic constants \\(C_{11}\\) and \\(C_{12}\\) accounting for specific strain deformations of the hcp basal plane are slightly larger in the IC crystal. At moderate and high pressures, however, the C phase is always stifier than the IC. Also, we find that the appearance of a finite superfluid fraction (e.g. \\(\\rho_{s}/\\rho\\sim 1\\) %) caused by the introduction of vacancies unequivocally provokes a small decrease of the \\({}^{4}\\)He shear modulus (i.e. \\(\\Delta C_{44}\\sim 1\\) %). We argue then that if a vacancy-induced normal-to-supersolid phase transition occurred in helium crystals containing isotopic impurities and line defects, dislocation-mediated contributions to \\(C_{44}\\) would totally overwhelm those stemming from mass superflow. As an alternative to usual dynamic experiments focused on the search of hypothetical supersolid manifestations, we suggest to perform spectroscopic measurements of the \\(E_{2g}\\) mode of \\({}^{4}\\)He at moderate and high pressures.What is the best summary of the discussion on the elastic properties of hcp solid \textsuperscript{4}He in a metastable IC state compared to the C ground-state?",

        "question": "Physicists have recently been pleasantly surprised by the prediction and then observation of new electronic states with intriguing properties, called \"topological surface states\".[1-5] The electrons in these states, which are found on the surfaces or the edges of small band gap semiconductors where the bulk of the material is electronically insulating (with caveats, as described below), display metallic conductivity with unusual characteristics. The inclusion of heavy atoms in the host bulk materials, causing spin orbit coupling to be high, is a critical factor in making the electronic states on the surfaces chiral, which imparts many of their unique properties. The chirality makes the surface state electrons immune from direct backscattering when encountering surface or edge defects. (Because the surface electron spins are locked perpendicular to their momentum, the spin orientation would have to flip in order for the electrons to change direction by 180 degrees, which is forbidden.) Their energy quantization is more Dirac-like (i.e. photon-like) than bulk-electron-like. These states have inspired predictions of new kinds of electronic devices and exotic physics, including proposals for detecting a long sought neutral particle obeying Fermi statistics called the \"Majorana Fermion\".[6, 7] Topological surface states were first observed by transport measurements on the edges of thin buried layers of HgTe in quantum wells fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE),[4] and by photoelectron spectroscopy on the surfaces of bulk crystals of Sb-doped Bi, Bi\\({}_{0.9}\\)Sb\\({}_{0.1}\\).[5] In principle, the discovery of a new type of electronic state is what is critically important, regardless of whether experimental observations are made on MBE-fabricated quantum wells, or on the surfaces of bulk crystals. The fact that the exotic electronic states can be observed on the cleaved surfaces of easily synthesized bulk crystals, however, means that a large number of experimentalists have been able to contribute to progress in understanding them, and has led to the explosion of interestin topological insulators in recent years, making the bulk-crystal-based materials of particular importance. In fact one can view the bulk-based topological insulators as \"ideal materials\" for condensed matter physics research: the physics is new and exciting, with plenty of opportunity for both new theory and experimental discovery, and the chemistry is \"simple\". In addition, the crystal structures are not too complex, and large, good quality crystals can be grown in many laboratories world-wide.Which of the following best summarizes the main idea of the provided excerpt?",

These predictions have been widely possible due to the fact that the current generation of electronic structure calculation programs can describe the bulk and surface electronic states of main-group-based materials. This has inspired electronic-structure-calculation-based predictions of new TIs that have ranged from calculating and screening the partial electronic structures of 60,000 compounds found in the ICSD database without human intervention, a study that at this time has not yet been formally published,[14] to predicting the detailed behavior for individual compounds, published in high impact journals.Which of the following best summarizes the focus and developments discussed in the current review of topological insulators?",

        "question": "From the perspective of solid state chemistry, the first order requirements for bulk topological insulators are relatively simple. First, the electron count of the compound must yield a semiconductor, either by simple electron counting or the Zintl concept. Next, the electronegativies of the elements whose orbitals are involved near the Fermi energy must be close to each other, resulting in strong covalency. The bonding should result in some mixing of the states that would normally be present at the bottom of the conduction band (i.e., states from the more electropositive element) into the top of the valence band, and states from the less electropositive element into the bottom of the conduction band. This would normally lead to a semimetal (a metallic conductor due to the presence of a continuous manifold of energy states that arises when the conduction band minimum dips below the valence band maximum for electrons at particular wave vectors), but the presence of spin orbit coupling splits the energies of the bands, analogous to the way crystal fields split orbital energies, and a small band gap semiconductor results instead. If the band gap is too big, then there is no mixing of the states, and if the overlap of states is too strong then the spin orbit coupling will not be enough to open a band gap. So a balance is needed. More detailed physics such as the parity and degeneracy of the bands is also important.Which of the following best summarizes the main requirements for a bulk topological insulator as described in solid state chemistry?",

(All the compounds described are at most polar covalent compounds, not ionic compounds, though we will use formal charges to describe the ions for convenience. For example, for the II-VI compounds described in this section, the Pauling electronegativities are 1.7, 2.0 and 2.1 for Cd, Hg and Te, respectively; so the compounds are not ionic.) The Hg\\({}_{1\\textrm{-}}\\)Cd\\({}_{\\textrm{x}}\\)Te materials are direct band gap semiconductors with the minimum energy difference between valence and conduction bands at the \\(\\Gamma\\) point ((0,0,0) in reciprocal space) in the Brillouin zone. (The Brillouin zone is the volume of reciprocal space that encompasses all the unique wavevectors for electrons in the solid. At the \\(\\Gamma\\) point, the electron waves are very long compared to crystallographic unit cell dimensions.) HgTe is therefore normally a metallic conductor. When a thin layer of HgTe is sandwiched between layers of CdTe, then the electrons are confined to a two-dimensionalconductive sheet. This causes the electrons to travel in spin polarized chiral states at the edges of the buried layer in the fabricated quantum wells.

        "question": "Elemental Bi and Sb are isostructural (Fig. 2a), with interesting crystal structures [18, 19]. Their ambient pressure structures are rhombohedral, space group R\\(\\overline{3}\\)m (\\(\\#\\)166). There is one symmetrically independent atomic site per cell, in Wyckoff position _6c_, coordinates (0,0,0.23389) for Bi and (0,0,0.23349) for Sb, plus atoms equivalent by inversion and the rhombohedral centering translations (2/3,1/3,1/3) and (1/3,2/3,2/3). (The positions of equivalents will not be given after this point. All of the rhombohedral phases will be described in the hexagonal coordinate system. All the structural information presented is for room temperature.) The hexagonal cell parameters are \\(a=4.546\\) A and 4.3084 A, and \\(c=11.862\\) A and 11.274 A for Bi and Sb, respectively. These are six layer unit cells, with the close packed layers of Bi or Sb in the sequence AB CA BC. The unit cell is actually made of three Bi or Sb bi-layers (emphasized by the use of spaces in the stacking sequence presented in the previous sentence). The c/a ratios are 2.61 and 2.62 respectively, much less than the c/a ratio for 6 layers of an ABCABC-stacked FCC material such as Cu, where the ratio is 4.9. This is because the Bi(Sb) bi-layers are almost collapsed into being a single layer, making them smaller perpendicular to the planes and larger within the planes than the ideal case. The bonds are stronger within the bi-layers than between adjacent bi-layers. Within the close-packed plane of the individual Bi (Sb)-layers, the interatomic distances are 4.546 A (Bi) and 4.308 A (Sb). Between layers in the bi-layer, the three Bi-Bi and Sb-Sb bonds are quite short, being 3.071 A and 2.908 A respectively. Between adjacent bi-layers the bonds are substantially longer, 3.529 A (Bi) and 3.355 A (Sb). The layered crystal structure of these elements is a consequence of the electronic configurations of elemental Bi and Sb (6p\\({}^{3}\\)6s\\({}^{2}\\) and 5p\\({}^{3}\\)5s\\({}^{2}\\) respectively) [20]. Each Bi or Sb atom is bonded to 3 nearest neighbors to close its valence shell, and the lone pair 6s or 5s electrons squeeze the 3 Bi-Bi (Sb-Sb) bonds stereochemically to one side of the central atom.What is the best summary of the structural characteristics of elemental Bismuth (Bi) and Antimony (Sb)?",

        "question": "To try to induce bulk insulating behavior in the Tetradymites, more complex ternary and quaternary phases have been studied. The fact that Sb\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) forms in a different structure type means that the full ternary Bi\\({}_{2}\\)-ySb\\({}_{y}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) and full quaternary Bi\\({}_{2}\\)-ySb\\({}_{y}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\)-xSe\\({}_{x}\\) solid solutions do not form for all compositions from \\(0\\leq\\mathrm{y}\\leq 2\\) and \\(0\\leq\\mathrm{x}\\leq 3\\). The quaternary solid solution has long been studied in the optimization of room temperature thermoelectric materials [27, 28]. In the ternary Bi\\({}_{2}\\)-ySb\\({}_{y}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) solid solution, the y limit is less than 0.5 [29]. There appears to be no report of long or short range Sb/Bi ordering in this series. Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) and Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) are isostructural and the full single phase solid solution series Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\)-xSe\\({}_{x}\\) is known for \\(0\\leq\\mathrm{x}\\leq 3\\)[24]. In this case there is a critical (from the TI perspective) long range ordering scheme within the solid solution (Fig. 4). Because the Te(1)/Se(1) site in the middle of the quintuple layer is more ionic in character (i.e., it is bonded to Bi in both the plane above and the plane below), that site fills first as the more electronegative Se is substituted for Te in Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\), filling virtually perfectly until y = 1 [24, 30, 31]. In other words the Tetradymite at the formula Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{2}\\)Se (BTS) is a crystallographically ordered compound and may be considered a distinct phase; thermodynamic anomalies at this composition have been observed, for example [32]. The structure of Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{2}\\)Se has been parameterized in space group R\\(\\overline{3}\\)m (#166) as is \\(a\\) = 4.3067 A, \\(c\\) = 30.0509 A; Bi position _6c_(0,0,0.3968); Se position _3a_ (0,0,0); Te position _6c_ (0,0,0.2116).[31] A recent structure determination has found about 4% mixing of Se on the Te sites (an electrically neutral defect) in Bridgman-grown crystals, by both STM and conventional XRD analysis.[31] The stacking sequence for Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{2}\\)Se is then: -[Te-Bi-Se-Bi-Te]\\({}_{0}\\)-[Te-Bi-Se-Bi-Te]\\({}_{1/3}\\)-[Te-Bi-Se-Bi-Te]\\({}_{2/3}\\)-. This compound has proven to be quite important in the TI field thus far because it can be made as a bulk insulator (i.e. with a resistivity of 1-10 ohm-cm at 4 K, compared to the 10\\({}^{\\text{-}3}\\) ohm-cm values typically found for the binary Tetradymites Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) and Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\)), with nearly balanced donor and acceptor states, facilitating the observation of the transport of the topological surface electrons. For x \\(>\\) 1 in Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3\\text{-}}\\)Se\\({}_{\\text{x}}\\), the selenium also partially occupies the Te sites on the outer layer of the quintuple layer sandwich, and a disordered solid solution phase forms with significant Te/Se mixing on the cleaved basal plane surface that supports the surface states.[24] Materials with x = 2, for example, can be written as Bi\\({}_{2}\\)(Te\\({}_{0.5}\\)Se\\({}_{0.5}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)Se. These Se-rich phases are naturally n-type and can be made p-type by substitution of Sb for half of the Bi, with the n to p crossover near (Bi\\({}_{0.5}\\)Sb\\({}_{0.5}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)(Te\\({}_{0.5}\\)Se\\({}_{0.5}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)Se.[33] Topological surface states have also been observed on the basal plane surfaces of these complex disordered quaternary (Bi\\({}_{1\\text{-}\\text{x}}\\)Sb\\({}_{\\text{x}}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)(Te\\({}_{1\\text{-}\\text{x}}\\)Se\\({}_{\\text{x}}\\))\\({}_{3}\\) solid solutions,[34] implying that structural disorder without charge disorder (the mixed ions have the same formal charge) is not necessarily a game-ending problem for the stability of topological surface states.Which of the following best summarizes the difficulties and findings related to inducing bulk insulating behavior in Tetradymites through ternary and quaternary phases?",

        "question": "The crystal structure has been solved for Bi\\({}_{2}\\)(Te\\({}_{0.8}\\)S\\({}_{0.2}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)S [39], and an interesting observation has been made about the effect of size mismatch on the crystal structure of Tetradymites (Fig. 5). As implied by the formula, the outer layers of the quintuple layer sandwich are occupied by an 80/20 ratio of Te to S. The crystal structure parameterization for Bi\\({}_{2}\\)(Te\\({}_{0.8}\\)S\\({}_{0.2}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)S is \\(a\\) = 4.196 A, \\(c\\) = 29.44 A; Bi _6c_ (0,0,0.39316); S(1) _3a_ (0,0,0); Te(2) _6c_ (0,0,0.21237), occupancy 0.8, S(2) _6c_ (0,0,0.2266) occupancy 0.2 [39]. The structure refinement clearly showed that the S atoms in the outer Te/S layer are closer to the Bi than the Te atoms are, consistent with a chemically reasonable Bi-S bond length. In other words, the layer of surface atoms that supports the topological surface states is randomly corrugated at the atomic scale as one passes over S and Te atoms at different heights. As is the case for the chemical disorder on this surface and the underlying layers present in the (Bi,Sb)\\({}_{2}\\)(Te,Se)\\({}_{3}\\) ternary and quaternary phases, the positional disorder at the atomic level does not appear to kill the surface states in Bi\\({}_{2}\\)(Te\\({}_{0.8}\\)S\\({}_{0.2}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)S, as they have been observed in this compound. Finally, consistent with Pauling's deduction about the importance of strain in Tetradymites, the amount of S needed to stabilize the compound is smaller when smaller Sb is partially substituted for Bi. The formula of the chemically stable, high resistivity material with the well isolated Dirac point for this quaternary Tetradymite correspondingly has a stoichiometric Te to S ratio, with the formula Bi\\({}_{1.1}\\)Sb\\({}_{0.9}\\)Te\\({}_{2}\\)S. Singlecrystals of this resistive material have been grown, and the Dirac point has been found by spectroscopy to be more than 100 meV above the top of the valence band, a favorable combination of properties.

It has been well studied from the crystallographic perspective and is an excellent example of the concept of the infinitely adaptive series in solid state chemistry [50, 51]. The idea is that very stable structural components, in this case Bi\\({}_{2}\\) bilayers and Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{3}\\) or Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) quintuple layers, may in rare cases maintain their identities and stack in arbitrary integer ratios, forming an infinite series of distinct compounds between the pure end members.

Distinct compounds are formed due to the stability of the individual building blocks, and, critically, because bonding between unlike blocks is preferred over bonding between identical ones.

        "question": "The crystal structure of GeBi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{4}\\) has been refined to a high degree of precision [63]. This has allowed the observation of a significant number of antisite defects in the compound. It crystallizes in space group R\\(\\overline{3}\\)m (#166); the cell parameters are \\(a\\) = 4.322 A (essentially equal to that found in Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\) where it is 4.39 A), and \\(c\\) = 41.270 A. There are four independent atom sites as follows: [Bi,Ge](1), in the middle of the septuple layer, position \\(3a\\) (0,0,0), occupied in a 0.5:0.5 ratio of Bi to Ge. The second metal atom site, [Bi,Ge](2), describes the outer two metal layers in the septuple layer sandwich, position \\(6c\\) (0,0,0.4273); it is occupied in a 0.65:0.25:0.1 ratio of Bi:Ge:Te. Thus this site has a very large number of Te antisite defects. These antisite defects balance the Bi antisite defects that are found on the Te layers. The Te atoms in the external layers (Te(2)) are in _6c_ (0,0,0.1344). These sites have 3% Bi antisite defects: they are occupied in the ratio 0.97:0.03 Te:Bi. The Te atoms in the internal Te layers (Te(1)) display a larger fraction of antisite defects. They are in position _6c_ (0,0,0.2903) with an occupancy of 0.93:0.07 Te:Bi. Determining site mixing occupancies to this kind of precision is usual for crystal structure determinations. It shows that the structure, like that of Bi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{3}\\), is very flexible to the occurrence of both Bi and Te antisite defects. Thus, although the compound has been made either p-type or n-type through variations in composition, there is not a strong driving force for maintaining stoichiometry or site occupancy, and therefore it will likely be difficult to prepare with a very low carrier concentration. The crystal structure for isostructural PbBi\\({}_{2}\\)Se\\({}_{4}\\), for which TI surface states have apparently also been observed has not been determined to a similar degree of precision and thus there is no crystallographic information available relevant to the defect chemistry [64].

        "question": "SnTe goes through a ferroelectric phase transition on cooling. The temperature of the transition is dependent on carrier concentration, and is accompanied by a cubic to rhombohedral structural distortion [74]. The phase transition maintains the basic crystal structure, but there is a distortion along the [111] direction, with the rhombohedral angles being slightly less than 90 degrees. This distortion is created by the Sn atoms moving slightly off center in the Te octahedra, which leads to the ferroelectric phase [75]. The temperature of the phase transition decreases with increasing carrier concentration; for SnTe with a p-type carrier concentration of 1.2 x 10\\({}^{20}\\) cm\\({}^{-3}\\), the phase transition occurs at 97.5 K; it is suppressed to 50 K at 5 x 10\\({}^{20}\\) cm\\({}^{-3}\\); and finally, the phase transition is not observed at a carrier concentration of 1.3 x 10\\({}^{21}\\) cm\\({}^{-3}\\)[75]. Meanwhile, doping with Pb lowers the transition temperature; by Pb\\({}_{0.6}\\)Sn\\({}_{0.4}\\)Te the phase transition is completely suppressed regardless of carrier concentration [76].

PbSe crystallizes in the rock salt structure, with a lattice parameter of 6.128 A. However, SnSe crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma (#62), and has a markedly different crystal structure; it is a layered compound with (SnSe) layers [77]. In these layers, Sn is coordinated to five Se atoms. This coordination is such that all five Sn-Se bonds point downwards, and the Sn atom is \"exposed\" from above, a consequence of the stereochemistry of the Sn lone pair. Within the layers, the configuration of the Sn-Se bonds alternates from up to down in one direction, and does not alternate in the other. Due to this marked structural difference, SnSe has a maximum solubility of 40% in PbSe; the Pb\\({}_{1\\text{-}}\\)xSn\\({}_{\\text{x}}\\)Se series maintains the rock salt structure only for \\(x<0.4\\).

        "question": "To truly predict whether a particular compound will display topological surface states requires the calculation of good quality bulk and surface band structures, and a theoretical analysis of the parity of the electronic bands. Materials chemists may thus have to rely on the published predictions of theoretical or computational physicists if they wish to find new TIs, but that comes with its own set of problems (see below). A simple set of chemical characteristics providing general guidelines can be deduced, however, from the known topological insulators. Firstly, heavy elements must be involved, to give significant amounts of spin orbit coupling. This is satisfied by elements from the 5s5p - 6s6p family, although the compound need not consist exclusively of such elements (e.g., GeBi\\({}_{2}\\)Te\\({}_{4}\\)). Secondly, in order for the most basic bulk electronic characteristics to be present, the mixing of electronic states dominated by the more electropositive element into the valence band and electronic states dominated by the more electronegative element into the conduction band must be present. This implies that the differences in electronegativities among the elements whose states are near the Fermi energy must be small. The presence of the spin orbit coupling impacts the energies of the states at the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band, deforming them from the usual parabolic energy vs. electron wave vector relationship found in most bulk materials. This spin orbit coupling can result in the opening of a band gap in cases where the material would have been a semimetal. The net result is that the highest chance of finding topological surface statescan be found for bulk materials that are either semimetals or semiconductors with band gaps less than about 0.4 eV. Finally there is the issue of crystal symmetry. For classical topological insulators to occur, the surface state bands must cross from the bulk valence band to the bulk conduction band an odd number of times over the whole Brillouin zone. A single crossing of the gap is possible for any material with axial symmetry if the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum are at the center of the Brillouin zone. This odd-crossing criterion can be satisfied for electrons of general wavevector if the symmetry of the surface of interest has three-fold symmetry, such as is found for bulk materials in Laue classes P3 or R3, e.g. as is found for the Tetradymites.Which of the following best summarizes the excerpt discussing the criteria and challenges in predicting topological insulators?",

        "question": "As seen from Table. 4, for LFO the inter-layer exchange parameters are AFM. This can be understood by noting that both exchange parameters originates primarily from virtual hopping of two \\(p_{z}\\) electrons of O\\({}_{ap}\\) ion into \\(3d\\) minority states of Fe and \\(5d\\) orbitals of R. These hoppings are the most effective for both apical oxygens in the exchange path only when spins on Fe ions are antiparallel. Otherwise, \\(p_{z}\\) electrons from different O\\({}_{ap}\\) ions cannot hop on the same orbital of the R ion. The above mechanism of AFM interlayer coupling is also present for LMO. In this case however, similarly as for in-plane exchange interactions, there is another type of low-energy excitations that can contribute to the interlayer exchange coupling. They involve hopping from occupied \\(3d\\) Mn states into empty \\(3d\\) states of Mn ion in the adjacent plane (note that this hopping is still mediated by O\\({}_{ap}\\) and R ions on the exchange path). Clearly, the most important hopping in this case is between filled majority \\(e^{\\prime}\\) and empty majority \\(d_{3z^{2}}\\) which prefers parallel spins. This leads to FM coupling which competes with AFM exchange interaction from the above paragraph. As a result either sign of interlayer exchange couplings is expected for LMO.What is the primary focus of the mechanism discussed regarding the inter-layer exchange interactions in LMO and LFO?",

Marom _et al._ have tested a variety of exchange correlation functionals for copper phthalocyanine [41], comparing local functionals such as LDA (local density approximation) [42] and GGA (generalized gradient approximation) [43; 44] with the semiempirical hybrid functional B3LYP [45], the non-empirical PBE [46], PBE hybrid (PBEh) [47], and the screened HSE [48]. While all these functionals describe the geometrical structure quite well, the local functionals underestimate the binding of orbitals at the molecule center. Additionally, GGA+U calculations have been performed in Ref.

        "question": "In general the optimized structures show a planar geometry except for the ScPc and CaPc, where the metal is slightly out-of-plane while the rest of the molecule undergoes a small bending towards the opposite direction. This effect becomes larger as the atomic radius of the metal increases, the Sc atom (with radius of 1.62 A) is displaced by 0.24 A from the molecular plane while Ca (with radius of 1.97 A) is shifted by 1.12 A. To confirm the observed trend we calculate the optimized geometry for YPc obtaining an out-of-plane displacement of 0.72 A. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that for ScPc the valence electron density (isosurface value = 0.15) appears distant from the metal center, beyond the Van der Waals radius of Sc, i.e., the metal departure from the molecular plane is caused by the repulsion between inner electron shells on the metal and on adjacent atoms.

The alphabet hereafter is used to denote the dimensions, for example, \\(a\\) for the first dimension, \\(b\\) for the second dimension, etc. The 1-D decomposition [2, 10], or slab decomposition, divides the 3-D data into equal blocks of complete \\(ab\\)-planes, for instance, along the \\(c\\)-axis, and requires only one transpose step with the smallest amount of communication, but the number of processes applicable is limited to the size of one dimension. The 3-D decomposition, or volumetric decomposition, partitions the 3-D data along all three dimensions [11, 12, 13, 14], and therefore three data transpose steps are necessary to perform the 1-D FFTs along the three dimensions, making the 3-D decomposition the costliest in terms of communication amount, yet the most scalable, as the maximum number of processes is equal to the size of the 3-D data. Sandwiched between the 1-D and 3-D decompositions is the 2-D decomposition (pencil or rod decomposition) [15, 16, 17, 18] that draws smaller amount of communication than the 3-D decomposition, and offers higher scalability than the 1-D decomposition, as the number of processes applicable is now up to the size of 2-D plane.Which option best summarizes the various methods of domain decomposition for 3-D FFT discussed?",

        "question": "In this paper, we present a decomposition method for parallelization of multi-dimensional FFTs with two distinguishing features: adaptive decomposition and transpose order awareness for achieving smallest communication amount compared to previously proposed methods. In our method, the FFT data are decomposed based on a row-wise basis that maps the \\(M\\)-D data into 1-D data, and translates the corresponding coordinates from multi-dimensions into one-dimension for equally dividing and allocating the resultant 1-D data to the processes. As a result, our method can adaptively decompose the FFT data on the lowest possible dimensions depending on the number of processes so that the communication amount can be minimized in the first place, differently from previous works that have fixed-dimensions of decomposition. In particular, the method decomposes in one dimension if the number of processes is less than or equal to the size of one dimension, in two dimensions if the number of processes is greater than the size of one dimension and less than or equal to the size of two dimensions, up to \\(M\\)-dimensions. Another unique feature of our method is the awareness of the transpose order. The row-wise decomposition provides plenty of alternatives in data transpose, and different transpose order results in different amount of communication. By analyzing all possible cases for transpose order, we find out the best transpose orders with smallest communication amounts for 3-D, 4-D, and 5-D FFTs. Finally, our method is generalized to \\(M\\)-D FFTs.Which of the following best summarizes the contributions and unique features of the presented decomposition method for parallelization of multi-dimensional FFTs?",

        "question": "We first investigate the adsorption characteristics of alkali adatoms Li, Na and K on silicene. The alkali metals are highly reactive metals and their chemical activity increases from Li to Fr. Characteristic bonding geometry of alkali atoms are depicted in Fig.3. Upon full geometry optimization, all alkali atoms Li, Na and K atoms favors bonding on the hollow site of the silicene layer. Adsorption of alkali atoms does not yield any significant distortion or stress on the silicene lattice. The valley site on the low-lying silicon atoms is the next favorable site. Though the top and valley site adsorptions are also possible, bridge site adsorption of alkalis is not possible on a silicene lattice. Therefore the bridge site adsorption is a kind of transition state between top and valley sites. Structural and electronic properties of alkali metals adsorbed on silicene layer are also presented in Table 2. Here the height of adatoms is calculated as the difference between the average coordinates of neighboring Si atoms and the adsorbate. The distance between the adatom and silicene surface monotonically increases with increasing atomic size. However, fully conforming to graphene,[64] there is no clear trend in the adsorption energies. While adsorption energies of Li, Na and K on graphene were calculated to be 1.1, 0.5 and 0.8 eV, respectively, their binding to silicene lattice is more than twice stronger, i.e. 2.4, 1.9 and 2.1 eV, respectively.

In Fig. 4 we present the energetics of different adsorption sites. For alkali atoms, shown in Fig. 4(a) it appears that the most likely migration path between subsequent hollow sites passes thorough the nearest valley sites. It is also seen that the energy difference between hollow and valley sites becomes smaller for larger atoms and therefore the diffusion of larger alkali atoms are relatively easier. Though alkali atoms strongly bind to the silicene surface, at high temperatures they may diffuse along hollow and valley sites when they overcome the energy barrier of 140-280 meV.Which of the following best summarizes the primary focus of the research on adsorbate atom pathways on silicene lattices?",

        "question": "\\(\\mathrm{E_{Ads}}\\) and \\(\\Phi\\). Because of the ionic nature of the alkali-silicene bonding, the workfunction linearly depends on the atomic size and therefore one can expect a significant decrease (>1 eV) in the workfunction for adsorption of larger alkalis on silicene. It is also seen that, while multivalent adatoms do not follow a particular trend in dipole moment, for alkali atoms workfunction shift exhibits a linear decrease with increasing dipole moment.\n\n## V Conclusions\n\nIn this study, we presented a first-principles investigation of the adsorption characteristics of alkali (Li, Na and K), alkaline earth (Be, Mg and Ca) and transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo and W) on silicene. Investigation of the interaction of silicene with metal atoms has a significant importance because of its fundamental relevance to applications in catalysis, batteries and nanoelectronics.What is the primary focus of the study on the interaction of silicene with various metal atoms?",

        "question": "We found that silicene has quite different adsorption characteristics as compared to graphene [65; 66] because of the diversity of adsorption geometries and its high surface reactivity. As a consequence of its buckled lattice structure, all the metal atoms bind strongly to silicene. While the binding energy of alkali and alkaline earth metals is 1-3 eV, transition metals have larger binding energies of 3-7 eV. Our diffusion path analysis shows that compared to graphene migration of metal atoms on a silicene lattice is more difficult and requires to overcome higher energy barriers. On the other hand, diffusion of metal atoms Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca may occur at moderate temperatures. Depending on the adatom type, semimetallic silicene can show metal, half-metal and semiconducting behavior. It was also noted that as a result of the high surface reactivity the direction of the charge transfer is always from metal adsorbate to silicene. However, the existence of charge donation and the resulting adatom-induced dipole modify the workfunction of silicene considerably. Especially the linear decrease in \\(\\Phi\\) for larger alkali adatoms is promising for tunable enhancement of electron and ion emission which is appealing to silicene-based thermionic converters and cathodes. Our findings also suggest that the half-metallic ferromagnetic nature of Ti- and Cr-decorated silicene have a great potential for silicon-based spintronic device applications. Moreover the existence of a tunable bandgap opening in silicene by alkaline earth metal adatoms is highly desirable for its use in nanoscale optoelectronic device applications.Which of the following best summarizes the study findings on the adsorption characteristics and potential applications of silicene when compared to graphene?",

        "question": "Le cadre general dans lequel s'inscrivait ce travail etait la diffusion multiple des ondes elastiques antiplanes dans les milieux solides elastiques. L'objectif etait l'etude de la diffusion multiple par une multitude de fissures antiplanes periodiquement distribuees. Au cours de la premiere partie de ce travail, l'etude de la diffusion par une fissure antiplane a permis de developper une equation integrale singuliere de type Cauchy. La forme particuliere de cette equation integrale se prete a la mise en couvre d'une methode de resolution numerique adaptee a la determination du saut de deplacement a travers la fissure. En employant la formule de representation d'une fissure plate et la condition de periodicite d'une rangee de fissures situees sur la meme droite antiplane, une equation integrale de frontieres a ete obtenue pour le saut de deplacement a travers une fissure dite de reference. Des resultats numeriques pour les coefficients de reflexion et de transmission ont ete presentes en fonction de l'espacement entre fissures, de la frequence d'excitation et de l'angle d'incidence. La seconde partie de ce travail avait trait aux reseaux bidimensionnels periodiques, constitues d'un empiement d'un nombre fini de reseaux lineaires infinis de fissures en milieu elastique. La methode de calcul de la diffusion par un reseau bidimensionnel repose sur la decomposition du reseau bidimensionnel en un nombre fini de reseaux lineaires periodiques et infinis qui forment alors des plans reticulaires. La diffusion par chacun des reseaux lineaires infinis est determinee par un calcul exact de diffusion multiple. La diffusion plan apres plan est calculee ensuite par une methode iterative ou a l'aide de la theorie de Floquet. Conformement aux theories des milieux periodiques, la presence de bandes interdites et permises dans le spectre des frequences a ete observee. Les effets dus a une perturbation de la periodicite ont egalemente analyses. Cette perturbation consistait a introduire un defaut aleatoire sur la position de chaque reseau lineaire. L'information principale qui en ressort est que les bandes d'arret sont tres sensibles a ce type de perturbation, disparaisant assez tot pour un faible desordre introduit.Which of the following best summarizes the objective and findings of a study on the multiple scattering of antiplane elastic waves in solid elastic media?",

Secondly, as the graphene is grown directly from the silicon carbide, a very strong electronic interaction between this substrate and the graphene is observed, which typically results in low carrier mobilities,[18, 31] unless special post-processing hydrogen treatments are applied.[32]Considering the disadvantages and necessary conditions associated with using silicon carbide (SiC) for graphene production, which of the following best summarizes the main challenges mentioned?",

        "question": "Figure 14 shows the results of such a patch-clamp experiment. A certain voltage sequence is applied across the cell membrane resulting in the opening of the potassium channels. The voltage-gating of the K\\({}^{+}\\)-channels is confirmed by measuring the current across the membrane with the help of the patch electrode (red curve in Fig. 14c) as well as by the response of the transistor (blue curve in Fig. 14c). The outflow of K\\({}^{+}\\) ions resulting from the cell stimulation induces an ionic current along the cleft formed between cell and transistor. Such a current translates into a local variation of the effective gate voltage of the underlying transistor. [8, 59] Figure 14c shows a single recording (light blue curve) from a transistor, which exhibits a signal-to-noise ratio of 13 with an RMS noise of 23 \\(\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro V}\\). As this kind of membrane currents is externally triggered with the patch pipette, the same process can be repeated several times yielding the same result. By averaging the transistor signals, it is possible to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio of 50. When the transistor signal is compared to the membrane current, small differences can be identified after the potential has changed. Both after opening and closing the ion channels, the membrane current changes faster than the transistor signal. This suggests that the coupling is not merely due to the charge transferred across the membrane. It has been suggested that the ion concentration in the cleft between the cell and the transistor changes due to the additional ions released through the ion channels. As the rate at which ions can leave the cleft is limited by diffusion, it can take some time until the conflux and efflux of ions reach equilibrium.[60] This local and temporary change of the ion concentration influences the nearby transistor, as discussed in section III.Which statement best summarizes the processes and outcomes discussed in the voltage-gating and measurement experiment involving potassium channels and transistors?",

Motivating the search for a solution is the desire to understand structure/property relationships in situations where disordered materials play a central role.

As these materials lack long-range periodic order, established crystallographic techniques cannot be used to produce structural models. Instead, techniques that are sensitive to the existence and nature of short-range structural correlations represent the only possibilities for experiment-driven structure determination.

To this end, we compared the outcomes for _a_-Si refinements based on configurations containing 64 and 512 atoms. Variation in box size has a number of consequences for the refinement strategy. Clearly the speed of convergence is much faster for small boxes. But there are more subtle differences as well. The quantity of data used in the fit also differs, for example, because \\(r_{\\rm max}\\propto N^{1/3}\\). It is not necessarily straightforward to adjust weightings to compensate fully for this change as variation in \\(N\\) also affects the discreteness of the calculated \\(G(r)\\), which in turn affects how closely the data can be fitted. Nevertheless we find that the optimal ratio of data and INVERT weighting for both 64 and 512 atom systems is roughly similar (the logarithmic difference between the two weightings is 2.55 for the former and 3.3 for the latter).

The polarization direction can be switched between two equivalent orientation states [1], and it is essentially this property that ferroelectric applications utilize. The nature of the phase transition dictates the number of orientation states available below the transition point, which is one of the prime reasons why the details of the ferroelectric transition are studied. The free-energy is expanded as a function of the order parameter, which allows one to write down an equation of motion and to show that at a continuous phase transition the soft-mode phonon frequency is zero [2]. In the well-known perovskite oxides, BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) and PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\), it is the transverse optical (TO) Brillouin zone centre mode that softens and results in the formation of a large tetragonal distortion through a first-order phase transition.

        "question": "PZT (PbZr\\({}_{x}\\)Ti\\({}_{1-x}\\)O\\({}_{3}\\))is among the most intensively studied ferroelectric oxides exhibiting exceptionally high piezoelectric properties when the amount of titanium and zirconium is roughly equal. Essentially because of local-scale disorder numerous space group assignments can be found in the literature. However, the average crystal structures as a function of \\(x\\) can be summarized thus: at room temperature the crystal structure remains tetragonal up to \\(x\\approx 0.52\\) at which composition (termed the morphotropic phase boundary, MPB) a rather complex set of phases emerges, including a monoclinic _Cm_ phase [15, 16, 17] and low and high-temperature rhombohedral phases. It is evident that the _Cm_ phase exists as judged by several high-resolution powder diffraction studies, but the phase transition mechanism resulting in an average monoclinic phase, and even the stability of the phase, is still under investigation as it is often linked to the extraordinary piezoelectric properties of PZT at the MPB composition. A thermodynamical study showed that an 8th-order Devonshire theory is required to explain the monoclinic phase [18], suggesting that the transition is quite unusual. This was also discussed in ref. [19], where a two-order-parameter thermodynamic model was developed for PZT to account for its peculiar features. At higher values of \\(x\\) the structure can, to a good approximation, be described as rhombohedral, there being two variants, with (_R3c_, at low temperatures) and without (_R3m_, at high temperatures) octahedral tilts. More precisely, neutron diffraction [20] and high-resolution x-ray diffraction [21] studies confirmed the rhombohedral phase and also revealed the presence of the monoclinic phase (assigned to the _Cm_ symmetry in ref. [20]), providing further support to the idea that the monoclinic phase is not due to the presence of adaptive phases. At the highest values of \\(x\\) an antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase is formed. The local disorder can be divided into Pb displacements (off-site \\(A\\) cations) and different positions of the \\(B\\) cations, _Zr_ and Ti [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. The role of a disordered \\(B\\) cation position was studied in detail in ref. [25] in a tetragonal Pb(Hf\\({}_{0.40}\\)Ti\\({}_{0.60}\\))O\\({}_{3}\\), a ferroelectric closely related and isostructural to PZT.What is the best summary of the complex phase transitions and structural characteristics of PZT (PbZr\textsubscript{\textit{x}}Ti\textsubscript{\textit{1-x}}O\textsubscript{3}) around the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB)?",

        "question": "To explain the observed Raman peak splitting and deviations from the analysis based on an idealized crystal a model in which the short-range order differs from the average long-range order is constructed. We first note that the number of peaks is significantly large: the \\(E\\)(1TO) mode is split into four, the \\(E\\)(2TO) mode into two, peculiarly the \\(E\\)(3TO) mode seems not to be split, and the \\(E\\)(4TO) mode is split into four peaks, whereas no splitting is expected by the symmetry analysis, and no peak splitting of the pure oxygen mode (\\(B_{1}\\) mode) is seen. A second observation is that the separation between the peaks remains approximately constant as a function of temperature. Thus, no indication of a low-temperature phase transition was found. As a third observation we note that the \\(A_{1}\\)(TO) modes are split, and the relative intensities of the peaks strongly change as a function of temperature (e.g., compare Figs.4 (a) and (g)). A fourth peculiarity is the high-frequency band approximately centered at 750 cm-1, well above the \\(A_{1}\\)(3TO) peak. We emphasize that the measurement geometry \\(x(zz)\\bar{x}\\) does not allow the observation of \\(A_{1}\\)(LO) modes. Nevertheless, the mode frequencies are in the same frequency range as the longitudinal \\(A_{1}\\)(3LO) mode (which is also split, the Raman shifts being 745, 777 and 818 cm-1). Thus, though the observation of the LO modes might be due to a domain(s) related to the prevailing crystal by a 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\) rotation about the \\(b\\) axis we seek another explanation. The puzzle is that no signs of \\(A_{1}\\)(1LO) (164 cm-1) or \\(A_{1}\\)(2LO) (448 cm-1) modes were seen, which shows that twinning does not provide a satisfactory explanation.Based on the analysis of Raman peak splitting in a non-idealized crystal, which of the following best summarizes the observations and conclusions drawn in the study?",

The experiments further show that PZT belongs to the realm of statistical mechanics, as textbook models for displacive perovskites do not work. We show that methods analogous to the treatment of magnetic materials (see, e.g., refs. 39-41) possess a large potential in disordered ferroelectric solid-solutions. We introduce a two-dimensional statistical model capable of explaining the observations and to further explain the composition-dependent transitions to lower-symmetry phases. To keep the model tractable, one structural block is introduced. We consider (110) Pb displacements and statistically distributed Ti and Zr atoms. Appendix II describes the mean-field model applied to generate the Zr/Ti and Pb-displacements shown in Fig. 5. The mean-field describes the Pb-Pb interactions, which results in large, uniform areas (coloured blue in Fig. 5). Without the mean field the Pb-displacements would be nearly random also in titanium rich areas, as one could intuitively expect and as was confirmed by computing simulations with no mean field. According to the simulations carried out for different compositions, the number of different configurations significantly increases in the vicinity of the MPB (see Fig. 2 in Appendix 0.2) so that an external electric field can favour a small number of states over the others. This results in a strongly increased electromechanical response, as is known to occur in this composition range [12]. Note that, according to an experimental study, 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\) domains in Ti-rich PZT hardly switch, whereas the domains in the two-phase region do switch [38].

        "question": "The short and long-range order of a Pb(Zr\\({}_{0.35}\\)Ti\\({}_{0.65}\\))O\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal were studied by Raman scattering. In strong contrast to PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\), the splitting of transverse \\(E\\)-symmetry modes reveals that there are different, locally ordered regions, which on average give tetragonal \\(P4mm\\) symmetry. A random distribution of Ti and Zr at the \\(B\\)-cation site and Pb ions displaced from their ideal positions are the types of defects making PZT different also from the viewpoint of the phase transition mechanism. In contrast to PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\), a simple expansion of the free energy in terms of order parameter is not sufficient. A statistical model, based on a single structure block, was found to be capable of explaining the observed peak splitting and phase transformations to a large number of different phases in the vicinity of the MPB. Thus, the results support the earlier idea that Pb ions respond readily to an applied electric field, here modelled as a transition between four available positions in each cell. The results further suggest that different crystal symmetries can be stabilized by cooling the crystal through the phase transition temperature under an applied electric field. Analogously to PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\), the coupling between local strain and transverse optical \\(E\\)(TO) modes is crucial, as is revealed by a flatter frequency-dependence on temperature compared with the \\(A_{1}\\)(TO) modes. Moreover, each transverse \\(A_{1}\\)(1TO) mode was split by anharmonic interactions as revealed by their temperature-dependent intensities. Thus, the origin of the peak splitting is different in \\(E\\)(TO) and \\(A_{1}\\)(TO) modes. No such coupling or anharmonic effects was evident in the \\(B_{1}\\) symmetry mode in which oxygen ions are displaced along the polarization direction.What is the best summary of the studied differences in the behavior and characteristics of Pb(Zr\textsubscript{0.35}Ti\textsubscript{0.65})O\textsubscript{3} single crystals compared to PbTiO\textsubscript{3} as indicated by Raman scattering results?",

Peak shapes were modeled with the Thompson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voight profile convoluted with axial divergence asymmetry, but the high resolution SXRD pattern revealed an additional asymmetry for many of the peaks (Figure 2). Using the prototypical Langasite structure, this resulted in a good fit to the data. However, to account for the additional peak shape asymmetry which may be due to anisotropic strain arising at the grain boundaries [20], the SXRD pattern was also modeled in FullProf as a convolution of two identical phases with very slightly different cell parameters. There is no indication that two distinct phases are actually present; even at the highest angles in the high resolution SXRD pattern there is a continuous distribution of intensity. For the final refinements of the structure, five diffraction patterns were co-refined simultaneously: four neutron diffraction patterns (Figure 3; at 2.41 A and 1.54 A at both 100 and 4 K) were simultaneously refined along with the SXRD data taken at 100 K, using the same Debye-Waller factor for both temperatures. All atomic positions were refined. For the 4 K data, the magnetic structure was also refined; this is described in a later section.

In the octahedral TeO\\({}_{6}\\) RBG, the three oxygen atoms above the tellurium are symmetry related to those below. This was initially set with a perfect octahedral orientation with one face of the octahedron parallel to the \\(ab\\)-plane and a fixed Te-O bond length of 1.927 A as determined from the initial refinements of Ba\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)P\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\). The phosphorous-oxygen tetrahedron is well characterized in the literature and is known to be fairly rigid in the solid state.[21] The PO\\({}_{4}\\) tetrahedron was modeled after \"orthophosphates proper\" and adjusted for the apical oxygen (O*) corner sharing with the lead polyhedra, and for the base oxygens (O**) edge sharing with the lead polyhedra.[21] This resulted in an initial model for the phosphate tetrahedron with the apical P-O* (roughly parallel to the c-axis) distance of 1.53045 A and a base P-O** distance of 1.546 A. The bond angles between the apex and the base (O*-P-O**) and within the base (O**-p-O**) were set as 111.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 106.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), respectively.Which of the following best summarizes the methodology used in the structural refinement of Pb\textsubscript{3}TeCo\textsubscript{3}P\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{14}?",

Initial refinements allowed for the translation of the PO\\({}_{4}\\) tetrahedra in three dimensions, and for the three symmetry inequivalent oxygen atoms forming the octahedron around tellurium to rotate as a unit in the _ab_-plane. The fit was further improved by allowing for the tilting and twisting of the PO\\({}_{4}\\) tetrahedra. For the co-refinement of the five diffraction patterns (four neutron diffraction patterns, at 2.41 A and 1.54 A at both 100 and 4 K and the SXRD data taken at 100 K) atomic positions and thermal parameters were constrained to be the same for both the high temperature and low temperature neutron and SXRD data. To account for thermal contraction of the unit cell, the _a:b_-ratio and the monoclinic \\(\\beta\\) angle were held constant in the neutron patterns since there was not sufficient resolution to distinguish the subtle differences in the temperature dependence of the metric distortion from trigonal symmetry. Careful analysis of the individual patterns indicated that no significant structural changes occurred between 5 and 100 K.

In the refinement of Pb\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)P\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\), the large cell posed a challenge for obtaining an accurate full superstructure determination from the powder data. With 78 unique atoms in the unit cell of Pb\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)P\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\), spanning from very heavy to very light, co-refinement of neutron and X-ray data was needed for a successful determination of the full superstructure. Careful use of hard and soft constraints on the atomic positions was employed to reach a final structural model. After lifting the RBG restraints and replacing them with soft bond length constraints, both TeO\\({}_{6}\\) and PO\\({}_{4}\\) polyhedra retained their shapes and did not distort significantly.

        "question": "The compounds all display typical Curie-Weiss behavior in low magnetic fields. In the case of Pb\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)V\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\), this is in agreement with a previous report [15]. For each of the three materials studied, the magnetic transition is reasonably sharp. The index of frustration (\\(\\theta\\)/\\(T_{n}\\)) is apparently low, but this is due to the low values of \\(\\theta\\) that artificially result from the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in these compounds. Heat capacity data for all three compounds showed sharp transitions corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordering. Pb\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)V\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\) exhibited two sharp transitions, as previously reported. The magnetic heat capacities (Figure 10) show that both Pb\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)P\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\) and Ba\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)P\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\) have anomalies below the sharp ordering peak that could potentially be representative of broad transitions. This is further corroborated by slight kinks in the high resolution magnetic susceptibility (Figure 9) at the corresponding temperatures. These transitions could be related to the second sharp transition observed in Pb\\({}_{3}\\)TeCo\\({}_{3}\\)V\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{14}\\), though further work is needed to analyze this complex magnetic behavior. All three compounds released a significant amount of entropy at temperatures above the 3D magnetic ordering transition. This suggests that short range ordering is present above the 3D ordering temperatures. Of the three, the Ba analog is most interesting from this perspective - it releases half of the entropy before the 3D ordering transition on cooling, suggesting the presence of much more substantial short range order before the 3D \\(T_{\\rm N}\\) than is exhibited by the other two compounds.What is the best summary of the provided text?",

        "question": "Optical spectroscopy has been adopted for studying the energy spectrum of electronic states of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in low-dimensional heterostructures with the aim of probing the states at energies away from the Fermi level [1,2]. The energy spectrum of the 2DEG is perturbed by the photoexcited holes via electron-hole Coulomb interaction. This holds true even in GaAs heterostructures although the Coulomb interaction is weak. Coulomb interaction may play major role for ZnSe heterostructures because ZnSe has an exciton with a 20 meV binding energy, compared with 4 meV for GaAs. Keller _et al._[3] reported the modification of the optical spectra with this interaction for ZnSe modulation-doped quantum wells (QWs), the phenomena of which are exemplified as exciton-like resonance in high magnetic fields and combined electron-exciton processes at small filling factors. The Coulomb interaction is expected to be even more important in another II-VI semiconductor--ZnO (the exciton binding energy in bulk ZnO is 60 meV). Recently, quantum Hall effect has been observed for \\(n\\)-type charged carriers in ZnO/Mg\\({}_{x}\\)Zn\\({}_{1-x}\\)O single heterojunctions (SHJs) [4-6]. Here, a mismatch in the spontaneous polarization between MgZnO and ZnO causes a strong electric field to accumulate two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a triangular-shaped potential near the interface of a ZnO/Mg\\({}_{x}\\)Zn\\({}_{1-x}\\)O SHJ. Further efforts in recent years resulted in the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, quantum Hall insulating phase, the enhancement of the effective Lande factor, and the increase in the mobility over 700,000 cm\\({}^{2}\\)V\\({}^{-1}\\)s\\({}^{-1}\\)[7-10]. Despite recent observation of the 2DEG-related photoluminescence (PL) in the absence of magnetic field [11], unlike the magneto-transport measurements routinely used to characterize the 2DEG, magneto-PL data have not yet been reported for ZnO HJs, to the best of our knowledge.Which of the following best summarizes the research discussed regarding optical spectroscopy and two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in low-dimensional heterostructures?",

        "question": "candidates for the assignment of the 2DEG-related PL. First, we argue about the recombination between the 2DEG and a localized hole near the interface. We can rule out this possibility by the following reason. The larger the spatial overlap of the electron-hole wavefunctions is, the higher the recombination probability is expected to become. Therefore, we limit ourselves to the case of radiative recombination with localized holes near the interface. Figure 2 shows the result of a self-consistent calculation of the energy band potential and energy levels at the heterointerface for ZnO SHJ (sample A) near the interface. The lineshape of the energy band potential suggests that the trapping efficiency for the holes generated initially in the alloyed barrier (i.e., MgZnO) is expected to be higher than those created in ZnO layer. The holes in ZnO tend to diffuse away from the 2DEG channel. Such a shallow interfacial centers at the barrier layer side is indeed known to be involved in the 2DEG-related recombination process in AlGaN/GaN heterojunction [23], the final state of the transition is located between the valence bands of alloyed AlGaN and GaN.

        "question": "We try to interpret the magnetic field dependence of the FWHM of PL from the viewpoint of the adequateness of the assignment to both postulations (the charged exciton and the 2De-h). Figures 3(g) and 3(k) respectively show the FWHMs as a function of the magnetic field for the samples A and B. As long as a single peak is assumed in the width evaluation, the \\(X^{-}\\) width increases with thresholds near the filling factors \\(v\\approx 3\\) and 2. As shown in Fig. 4, a closer look at the spectral features for sample A in these magnetic field regions (26 to 29 T) reveals a splitting into two different components, which results in the seeming enhancements in the FWHM. As schematically drawn in Fig. 5, the splitting observed at strong magnetic field is known to be originated from the singlet (\\(X_{S}^{-}\\)) -triplet (\\(X_{T}^{-}\\)) splitting in the picture of charged exciton. Attempts will be made hereafter as to how we can soundly interpret these experimental findings based on the assumption of the assignment to the charged exciton. At zero magnetic field, \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) is preferred [27, 35], while \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) should be the ground state at the extreme magnetic field limit [35, 36]. As shown in Fig. 4(a), a natural interpretation drawn from this \\(B\\)-dependent stability is that the PL intensity in sample A is redistributed significantly in favor of \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) at 29 T (\\(v=2.57\\)) after the coexistence with \\(X_{S}^{-}\\). Then, the PL of \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) weakens at fields corresponding to \\(v\\approx 2\\) [lowest trace in Fig. 4(b)]. At 41 T (\\(v=1.82\\)) [Fig. 4(b)], however, the intensity of \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) starts to become larger than that of \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) again. This is also true even at the maximum available field (i.e., \\(B=54\\) T). Based on this, the singlet state is probably the ground state of charged exciton for the accessible field strength range (\\(0\\leq B\\leq 54\\) T). As drawn schematically with the red bold lines in Fig. 5, the _resonance_ energy of \\(X_{T}^{-}\\)is very close to that of \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) at \\(B\\geq 26\\) T. The energy of \\(X_{T}^{-}\\)is, however, still higher than that of \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) even at \\(B=54\\) T. We observe \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) PL peak that has higher intensity over intermediate magnetic field range near the filling factor of \\(v=3\\). This could be due to the fact that the spin polarization (\\(P\\)) of the 2DEG at \\(v=3\\) is \\(P=1/3\\), which is higher than that at \\(v=2\\) (\\(P=0\\)). The higher the spin polarization is, the more probably the spins of electrons in a triplet charged exciton are oriented in a same direction. The \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) PL energy is lower than the \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) PL energy despite the absence of a singlet-triplet crossover of a charged exciton ground state. As shown schematically in Fig. 4(a), these seemingly incompatible results may be explained by considering that the spin state of electrons which remain after \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) recombination is different from that after \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) recombination [37]. If the final state of \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) recombination resides the upper state unlike the case of \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) recombination, \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) PL energy in Fig. 5 is larger than that of \\(X_{S}^{-}\\) PL, as indicated by the lengths of the arrows. As drawn with the red bold lines, because the resonance energies are closely situated, the splitting energy of the final state (i.e., the electron Zeeman energy \\(\\Delta E_{e}=g\\mu_{B}B\\)) determines the difference in the PL peak energies (i.e., the arrow lengths) [37]. The assignment of \\(X_{T}^{-}\\) consistently explains the magnetic field dependence of the \\(X^{-}\\) PL intensity.

        "question": "It is of fundamental importance to study macroscopic behavior of open quantum systems under the influence of dissipative baths that they are inevitably in contact with [1; 2]. As an open quantum system and its thermal bath with a finite number of modes together form an isolated system which conserves the energy, according to the Poincare recurrence theorem [3], the quantum system will eventually return to a state very close to its initial state. To circumvent this recurrence, the bath has to be expanded to contain an infinite number of phonon modes. The simplest model of a quantum system is a two-level system \\(\\hat{H}_{\\rm S}=-\\Delta\\sigma_{x}/2\\), and Caldeira and Leggett[4] have shown that a bath of harmonic oscillator, \\(\\hat{H}_{\\rm B}=\\sum_{l}\\omega_{l}b_{l}^{\\dagger}b_{l}\\), provides a very good approximation to real dissipative systems. Here \\(\\sigma_{x}\\) is a Pauli matrix, and \\(b_{l}^{\\dagger}\\) (\\(b_{l}\\)) is the boson creation (annihilation) operator. In general, it is assumed that the two-level system is linearly coupled to the bath, \\(\\hat{H}_{\\rm SB}=-\\sigma_{z}\\sum_{l}\\lambda_{l}(b_{l}^{\\dagger}+b_{l})/2\\). In the absence of the bath, the quantum two-level system will oscillate between the states \\(|+\\rangle\\) and \\(|-\\rangle\\) with frequency \\(\\Delta\\) (\\(|\\pm\\rangle\\) are the two eigenstates of \\(\\sigma_{z}\\)), a quantum phenomenon which has no classical analog.

        "question": "with a cutoff frequency \\(\\omega_{c}\\) and a dimensionless constant \\(\\alpha\\) measuring the strength of the coupling. A bath described by a spectral function with \\(s=1\\) is referred to as an Ohmic bath. Both static and dynamical properties of the spin-boson model with an Ohmic bath are well understood [1; 2]. It is found that there exists a quantum phase transition from a non-degenerate delocalized phase to a doubly degenerate localized phase and a turnover from a coherent phase to an incoherent one. The critical coupling for the quantum phase transition is \\(\\alpha_{c}\\approx 1\\), and the critical coupling for the turnover to occur is \\(\\alpha_{\\rm CI}\\approx 0.5\\). In the Ohmic regime, the spin-boson model can be readily mapped onto the anisotropic Kondo model using bosonization techniques[1], and known results can be borrowed from the Kondo model.

        "question": "Unlike in the Ohmic regime, dynamics of sub-Ohmic spin-boson model is very sensitive to the initial conditions. There are two initial conditions of interest: one is the factorized initial condition with the bath in its vacuum state initially; the other is the polarized initial condition consistent with typical experimental scenarios [2], under which the system is prepared in the ground state of \\(H_{\\rm B}+H_{\\rm SB}|_{\\sigma_{z}=1}\\). Many recent studies use the polarized initial condition [11; 12; 13; 15]. The typical time scale of the spin dynamics is \\(1/\\Delta\\), the time it takes to hop from a spin state to another. On the other hand, the reorganization energy [18], which describes the change in population disparity between the two states \\(|+\\rangle\\) and \\(|-\\rangle\\) as one goes from the initial condition to the other, is given as \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty}d\\omega J(\\omega)/\\omega=2\\alpha\\omega_{c}\\Gamma(s)\\), where \\(\\Gamma(s)\\) is the gamma function of s. Ref. [18] shows that the difference in spin dynamics under the two initial conditions is negligible for the Ohmic bath in the scaling limit \\(\\Delta\\ll\\omega_{c}\\). However, reorganization energies in the sub-Ohmic regime are larger than those in the Ohmic regime. It implies that much more time is needed for a sub-Ohmic bath to return to thermal equilibrium, and therefore the spin dynamics corresponding to the two initial conditions will display sizeable differences for certain parameter space \\((\\Delta/\\omega_{c},s)\\). Ref. [11] has confirmed such a physical picture. It is commonly accepted that the increasing of the spin-bath coupling will eventually turn quantum coherent oscillations into classical-like damping, a picture supported by the aforementioned numerical approaches for \\(1/2<s<1\\). However, Ref. [15] has recently claimed that such a picture may not always hold. Numerical data in the strong coupling regime, for example, with \\(\\alpha=30\\alpha_{c}\\), show that the coherent phase exists for exponents up to \\(s=0.49\\). Such an \"anomalous\" result warrants further investigations.Which of the following best summarizes the sensitivity of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model dynamics to initial conditions and the implications for spin dynamics?",

It is clearly seen that oscillatory behavior emerges even for very strong coupling far beyond \\(\\alpha_{c}\\). Furthermore, the characteristic oscillation frequency of \\(P_{z}(t)\\) increases with increasing \\(\\alpha\\). Our results agree with those of Kast _et al._ obtained using the real-time path integral Monte Carlo simulation[15]. It is widely accepted that under the polarized initial condition, a quantum dissipative system such as the spin-boson model is expected to display classical over-damped behavior (or incoherent phase) at strong spin-bath couplings. Our results reveal that this is not the case for \\(0<s<0.5\\). However, such apparent contradictions only appear for the polarized bath initial condition. For the factorized initial bath condition, the persistent coherence does not occur. The upper panel of Fig. 2 shows the population difference as a function of time, \\(P_{z}(t)\\), under the factorized bath initial condition.

        "question": "XPCS is the X-ray analogue of the very successful technique of dynamic light scattering or Photon Correlation Spectroscopy [2]. PCS is well established to characterize the equilibrium dynamics of soft condensed matter by determining the intensity autocorrelation function of the scattered laser light as a function of delay time and wave-vector transfer. Similarly, XPCS [3], using coherent synchrotron radiation instead of visible laser light, is being widely used for studies of soft matter dynamics where objects are in the nanometre range (see e.g. [4, 5, 6, 7]). Attention has also been directed towards studies of metal systems as shown by the feasibility test on the (100) Bragg peak of Cu\\({}_{3}\\)Au [8] or of critical dynamics in Fe\\({}_{3}\\)Al [9]. Because of the short X-ray wavelength, XPCS seems to be predestined for studies at atomic length scales. These types of experiments have, however, never been reported in the literature until a successful demonstration of the capability of XPCS to resolve single atomic motion in condensed matter [10]. Particularly, we have clarified the mechanism of atomic dynamics in Cu\\({}_{90}\\)Au\\({}_{10}\\)[10, 11] and studied dynamics in a metallic glass [12].Which of the following best summarizes the advancements and applications of XPCS as discussed in the text?",

        "question": "For a coherent method like aXPCS two atoms of the same species exchanging their positions do not affect in any way the scattering pattern, as the configuration of the coherently illuminated volume before and after the jump is exactly the same. Compared to non-coherent methods it is, however, necessary to account for the short-range order, i.e. for the influence of the surroundings on the movement of each distinct atom. This phenomenon has first been described qualitatively for coherent neutron scattering in liquids by de Gennes [23]. The physical principle for the so-called de Gennes narrowing is based on the fact that peaks in the structure factor of liquids occur at wave-vectors corresponding to the most probable interatomic separation, i.e. they are responsible for the highly correlated and long living atomic arrangements. The same argument holds for the short-range order intensity (\\(I_{\\rm SRO}\\)) in alloys where the higher diffuse intensity between Bragg peaks corresponds to a longer lifetime of certain configurations of solute atoms.Which of the following best summarizes the principles underlying coherent methods like aXPCS according to the text?",

        "question": "can influence the correlation time. Therefore measurements at arbitrary azimuthal angles are equivalent. For the single crystal sample an additional second scan for fixed \\(|\\vec{q}|\\) and different azimuthal angles \\(\\phi\\) was performed. Measurements were performed in transmission geometry in a resistively heated vacuum furnace (\\(p\\leq 10^{-6}\\) mbar). The temperature was stabilized by a PID temperature controller within a range of 0.1 K. The measurement time at a fixed scattering vector \\(\\vec{q}\\) was between 20 and 40 minutes at a frame rate of one frame every 10.9 seconds (exposure plus readout time). Due to the limited intensity of the synchrotron source and low scattering intensity at large scattering angles in the diffuse regime it is beneficial to make the data collected by the CCD camera subject to the so-called droplet algorithm [27] to detect single photon events. Our implementation of the droplet algorithm is described in [24]. These corrected images were evaluated according to equation (1), finding the correlations in the fluctuating speckle intensities (see figure 1) where the autocorrelation function was averaged over all pixels to obtain sufficient statistical accuracy.What is the best summary of the provided text snippet?",

Two kinds of atoms were arranged in a proportion of \\(N_{\\rm Pt}/N_{\\rm Ni}=3/97\\) over an fcc-type lattice with periodic boundary conditions. One vacancy was introduced by randomly emptying a lattice site. The simulation consists in iteratively choosing one of the 12 lattice sites of the vacancy's first coordination shell randomly, then, according to the Metropolis algorithm, calculating the probability \\(p_{i\\to f}=\\exp{(-\\Delta E/k_{B}T)}\\), where \\(\\Delta E=E_{f}-E_{i}\\) denote the system energies calculated with pair potentials for nearest-neighbours before (\\(i\\)) and after (\\(f\\)) the jump, respectively, where \\(k_{B}\\) is the Boltzmann constant and \\(T\\) the absolute temperature. A decision to perform a jump or not was taken by comparing \\(p_{i\\to f}\\) with a random number. A unit time (MC step) was defined as a number of trials equal to the number of lattice sites. After equilibrating the system, the actual diffusion simulation was started. After every half Monte Carlo step a discrete Fourier transform of the lattice was carried out and the amplitudes were used to calculate the scattering intensity and the amplitude autocorrelation function \\(g^{(1)}(\\vec{q}\\), t) for certain \\(\\vec{q}\\) values. Finally, using Siegerts relation, the intensity autocorrelation function was calculated and compared with the experimental correlation time.Which of the following best summarizes a simulation study designed to investigate the diffusion process using a Monte Carlo method?",

Detailed data about SRO like in the case of Cu\\({}_{90}\\)Au\\({}_{10}\\)[30] is rarely available. SRO must be actually measured for exactly the same alloy composition and temperature as the sample under study. It is very difficult to deduce short-range order data from experimentally measured intensity data. A detailed description of the diffuse scattering theory can be found in several articles and books (see e.g. [31, 32] and literature cited therein). The factor which actually makes the analysis of diffuse scattering so difficult and time consuming is the separation of SRO scattering (which is of interest to us) and atomic displacement scattering. Simulations showed that in a system with a very high scattering contrast and low solute atom concentration like Ni\\({}_{97}\\)Pt\\({}_{3}\\), the magnitude of those two terms can be of the same order.

There was a weak tendency found for a Cu\\({}_{3}\\)Au-type ordering for Ni\\({}_{1-x}\\)Pt\\({}_{x}\\) with \\(x=0.2\\) composition [34] which is also indicated by the diffuse intensity for \\(x=0.03\\) as shown in the inset in figure 2. There is, however, no data for short-range order configuration on a system with \\(x=0.03\\) available in the literature. Note that our main goal remains an atomistic diffusion mechanism and the details of the diffuse scattering intensity are not vitally important. Therefore we choose two simple models: (m1) a model with no interaction between the atoms and (m2) a model with strong Pt-Pt repulsing force. The latter was chosen because a L1\\({}_{2}\\) ordering type tendency resulting from strong Pt-Pt nearest-neighbour repulsion was assumed to be more likely than from Pt-Pt next-nearest-neighbour attraction or further ranging interactions 1. The two model systems m1 and m2 were simulated using a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm (see section 4). From the atomic configuration we calculated the Warren-Cowley parameters [35].

[1] They can crystallize in the thermodynamically stable hexagonal configuration with a wurtzite crystal structure and in a cubic modification with a zincblende structure. Due to the low symmetry of the wurtzite system, hexagonal nitrides do not only show strain-induced, but also spontaneous polarization.

        "question": "Crystallization is a process of formation of a new phase and it is of great importance not only in nature, but also in the technology of materials. In nature, one simple and typical example for crystallization is the formation of snowflakes and formation of rocks. Sugar and chocolate are also result of crystallization processes. In recycling industry, crystallization (and recrystallization) is a concomitant process during sintering, which is a key method for obtaining new materials. In principal, the formation of a new phase by crystallization is always accompanied by volume shrinkage of the initial phase, herein and after considered to be a liquid monoatomic melt. The degree of this volume shrinkage mainly depends on the ratio of the densities of the initial and the newly formed phase. It also depends on the kinetics of formation of the new phase and the position of formation of over critical size nuclei onto which the growth process takes place. This growth process consumes the parent phase in a concurrent manner - bigger is the newly formed phase, bigger is the consumption from the parent phase. Thus, the new phase forms individual crystallites that are more or less miss oriented one to another and as a result they might form a rigid skeleton (of the new phase) which hinders the further volume shrinkage of the initial system. This stage of the system evolution is called percolation threshold. Depending on the nature of the system, the percolation threshold appears at different degrees of transformation towards the new phase. For \"pure\" systems like metals this threshold is observed after 60 - 70 % of a new phase formation, while for diopside-albeit systems under sintering conditions the shrinkage becomes negligible after comparatively small amount - 10 - 20 % of crystal formation (Karamanov A., Pelino M., 2006). As a consequence after this moment the system is not able to decrease its volume and considerable amount of parent phase is locked into the rigid skeleton of the new phase. Since the system trend is to lower its energy, the crystallization process continues inside the formed rigid core regions. Thus the remaining liquid melt becomes a subject of stress accumulation, which leads to a void formation into the parent phase, namely a crystallization induced porosity (CIP). Strikingly, CIP improves the mechanical properties of the sintered materials (Karamanov A., Pelino M., 2008) and rises question about the role of such \"defects\", which are classically considered to decrease materials functionality. This phenomenon is the basic motivation to perform Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) on crystallization of liquid melts, comparing two cases - free standing melt and a melt confined into an already formed crystalline core. The main questions that we try to answer by means of MCS are: where starts the nucleation of the new phase - bulk or surface crystallization is the fastest process. What is the influence of the already formed rigid core on the crystallization of the residual parent phase, and where appears the CIP. In order to answer these questions we start our simulations on a free standing liquid melt, where we vary the size of the system and initial packing fraction, then we continue with a melt confined into a rigid core and finally we compare these two cases in 2D and 3D.Which of the following best summarizes the main focus of research on the crystallization process as outlined in the provided text?",

This is a pair wise potential with one global minimum and it inevitably leads to a formation of a hexagonal closed packed (_hcp_) crystalline structure. We use the NVT Metropolis sampling technique (Landau D., Binder K., 2009) - constant number of particles, constant volume and constant temperature and our simulations are performed according to the phase diagram of the LJ model (Tang, J. et al., 2002), with reduced temperature \\(T^{*}\\!=\\!k_{B}T/\\varepsilon\\), where \\(k_{B}\\) is the Boltzman constant. The crystallization process is monitored at every Monte Carlo step by means of several quantities - the total energy of the system, the number of crystalline particles, the pair distribution function (PDF) and the histogram of particles displacements vs. their initial positions. The first minimum of PDF at each Monte Carlo step is used to determine the radius of the so called first coordination shell, which is used to determine the coordination number of each particle (degree of crystallinity). Here we use the strictest condition and in 2D case we label a particle as a crystal one only if it has exactly six neighbors into the first coordination shell. In the case of 3D we use the condition that a particle is labeled as a crystalline one if it has 10 or more neighbors into the first coordination shell.

        "question": "Careful examination of the rigid crystalline core (by means of 'tomography like' slices) shows that it is formed all over the sub-surface layer of the system. Immediately after the formation of this core (reaching of a percolation threshold), the system stops its shrinkage, leaving a considerable amount of a liquid melt phase inside it. This amount of liquid phase tends to crystallize further, but since the system had already reached its percolation threshold and cannot further shrink its volume, we believe that a stress is accumulated into the liquid phase. This stress leads to a break into the liquid phase - this is the so called crystallization induced porosity, which forms closed pores inside the volume of the newly formed phase. This result is the second milestone in our work, and it leads to further simulations concerning a confined liquid melt in an already formed rigid crystalline core.\n\n### Case2: Confined melt in a rigid crystalline coreWhich of the following best summarizes the process described in the given text regarding the formation and characteristics of the rigid crystalline core?",

        "question": "This is the role of the already formed crystalline core - it prevents the shrinkage, thus the inner parts of the melt become a subject of stress accumulation and as a result the crystallization induced porosity is presented. Crystallization of a 3D liquid melt confined in an already formed (_hcp_) crystalline phase is shown on Figure 8. Only the outermost two layers of the crystalline phase are fixed. The melt crystallizes both in its volume and on the crystal core, perfectly reproducing the (_hcp_) arrangement. Thus the crystal core plays role of a sink for the melt phase particles, leading to a predominant consumption near the boundary melt/crystal core. Simultaneously into the volume crystal phase is also formed. This means that there are two \"crystal fronts\" which consume the liquid phase in a concurrent manner, and here one must have in mind the \"focusing\" effect of the curvature of the crystalline core (Karamanov A. et al., 2010). The whole system cannot shrinks since the outermost two surface layers are fixed, hence the liquid inside accumulates stress, and as a result (which may be thought as a stress relaxation (or stress responce) phenomenon) the liquid breaks forming a crystallization induced porosity.Which of the following best summarizes the process and effects described in the crystallization of a 3D liquid melt confined in an already formed crystalline phase?",

Among the most prominent examples are the color of Au and the fact that Hg is a liquid at ambient conditions.[1] These observations are commonly attributed to the inert pair effect (IPE), which is the contraction and stabilization of the 6s orbitals in the context of the Lanthanide contraction and relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals greatly influences the chemistry of the heavy \\(p\\)-block elements. TlCl\\({}_{3}\\) (Tl\\({}^{3+}\\) 6s\\({}^{0}\\)), for example, readily decomposes to form TlCl (Tl\\({}^{1+}\\) 6s\\({}^{2}\\)) and Cl\\({}_{2}\\). Relativistic effects are not only important in inorganic chemistry but also in materials science and condensed matter physics. The unique physics of topological insulators is due to compounds with heavy atoms that show strong relativistic effects.[2] For a review on relativistic effects in general see reference [1]. Here we study the relationship between superconductivity and charge instabilities due to the IPE in perovskite related structures. We focus on Tl compounds in particular, since Tl is the element with the most pronounced IPE known, and as a consequence is most stable in its +1 (6s\\({}^{2}\\)) rather than its +3 (6s\\({}^{0}\\)) oxidation state.Which of the following best summarizes the role of relativistic effects in chemistry and related fields?",

The vHS has been cited as important for the occurrence of superconductivity in perovskites and other materials.[13] It also suggests that a structural distortion is necessary to stabilize this compound, driven by the need to decrease the density of states (DOS) at E\\({}_{F}\\) that is present due to the vHS in the ideal cubic phase.

Figure 2 shows plots of energy versus volume for the different structures, for doped and undoped compounds. For the undoped compound, the breathing mode structures have a significantly lower energy than structures with regular octahedra, even for the case of dramatically decreased cell volumes.
