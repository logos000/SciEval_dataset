        "question": "After cadmium diffusion, the crystal surface was characterized by p-type conductivity. In comparison with annealing dopant-free samples, the crystal doping with cadmium in vacuum had no significant impact on quantum efficiency of radiative transitions through EL2 centers (Fig. 2, curve 3). Under excess arsenic pressure, cadmium diffusion resulted in a significant (by 2-3 orders at the crystal surface) decrease of \\(I_{0.65}\\) as compared to typical \\(I_{0.65}\\) values for the case of dopant-free annealing (Fig. 2, curve 4). The nature of quantum yield changes for radiative transitions through EL2 defects in the case of cadmium doping seems to be same that in the case of copper doping [3]. Namely, the reason for \\(h\\nu_{\\rm m}=0.65\\) eV intensity decrease is the lowered concentration of separated EL2 defect resulting from EL2 - Cd complex formation. The fact that the effect is observed only at diffusion in arsenic atmosphere may be explained as follows. As cadmium atoms in GaAs mainly occupy Ga vacancies [6], they can enter the complexes as EL2 - Cd\\({}_{\\rm Ga}\\) (cadmium diffusion occurs according to dissociative mechanism and the formation probability of EL2 - Cd\\({}_{\\rm-}\\) complexes with interstitial atoms is low).question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

At the same time, the displaced atoms can occupy gallium vacancies, the concentration thereof at crystal surface being increasing during heat treatment in arsenic atmosphere according to the law of active mass [6]. The \\(I_{0.65}\\) decrease resulting from selenium diffusion at vacuum heat treatment can be connected with decreasing efficiency of emission through EL2 defects due to EL2-Se complex formation, as in the cases with cadmium and copper. Thus, diffusion of Se atoms occurs into areas where the concentration of As vacancies V\\({}_{\\rm As}\\) generated due to arsenic evaporation from the surface is higher than that in the crystal volume.

For example, a design of novel multiferroic materials with a strong ME coupling was proposed by exploiting epitaxial strain and spin-phonon coupling.[19] A stronger ME effect may also occur in multiphase composites of electrostrictive (or piezoelectric) and magnetostrictive (or piezomagnetic) compounds, mediated through strain across interfaces.[20] In such composite materials, strain induced in one component due an applied electric field is transferred to the other component where, due to the magnetostrictive response, there is a corresponding change in the magnetization.[6, 7, 21]question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

One of the suggested mechanisms for this kind of ME effect follows from the first-principles study of the Fe/BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) interface,[22] which shows that the change in bonding between atoms across the interface leads to a change in interface magnetization when the polarization of the ferroelectric BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) is reversed.[22, 23] The ME effect due to the interface bonding mechanism is also expected to play a role for Co\\({}_{2}\\)MnSi/BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\)[24] and Fe\\({}_{3}\\)O\\({}_{4}\\)/BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\)[25] interfaces. Another suggested route is due to the build-up of spin-polarized free-carriers near the surface or interface of a ferromagnetic metal.[26] In such a case, a net change in spin density can be found on the ferromagnetic metal surface/interface due to the spin-dependent nature of the screening charges.[26, 27, 28, 29] In some systems more exotic effects due to the accumulation of screening charge may also give rise to substantial ME effects. For example, it was predicted that the change in screening charge at the La\\({}_{1-x}\\)Sr\\({}_{x}\\)MnO\\({}_{3}\\)/ BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) interface due to reversal of the ferroelectric polarization can drive a magnetic reconstruction near the interface, changing the magnetic order of Mn spins from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic.[30] It was also predicted that even the magnitude of exchange splitting giving rise to itinerant ferromagnetism can be modulated by electrostatic screening. This effect was demonstrated from first-principles at the SrRuO\\({}_{3}\\)/BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) interface,[31] where SrRuO\\({}_{3}\\), a relatively weak itinerant ferromagnet, experiences a pronounced change in exchange splitting upon reversal of the ferroelectric polarization in the BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\). This prediction has led us to explore the possibility of the electric-field-induced itinerant ferromagnetism at an otherwise paramagnetic metal surface.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

Fig. 3a demonstrates the shape of electrostatic potential used to generate the applied electric field. Fig. 3b shows the profiles of the induced screening charge density averaged over the cross sectional area of the supercell and calculated for different values of electric field. It is seen that the amplitude of the screening charge on the Pd surface increases with the field. We also note the presence of the Friedel-like oscillation of the induced change density decay into the slab, which is typical for surface electronic screening.[51] A double peak for the screening charge on the Ag surface is also seen in Fig. 3b when the field is above 1.2V/A. This is due to the potential well lying close to the silver surface that tends to attract the electrons to the dip of the potential energy located at \\(z=29\\)A. This charge accumulation in vacuum is an artifact of the calculation which is performed using periodic boundary conditions and hence requires a sawtooth potential to introduce an electric field.

We found an induced magnetic moment on the surface Pd monolayer when the electric field exceeds a critical field.

IV) which tends to pull Te atoms towards the trivalent impurity. These local distortions in the lattice geometry can potentially assist the formation of impurity-rich domains (e.g., Ag-Sb-rich nanoscale domains) in PbTe-, SnTe-, and GeTe-based systems.

In these cases, we also identify impurity-induced bands. We observe bands which are split off from the valence-band top and the conduction-band bottom.

The contour plot shown in Fig. 8 clearly indicates that the hybridized \\(p\\) states coming from the two Te atoms in the Ag-Te-Sb-Te chain are stabilized by Ag.

In the first applications of AFM only the sample topography was measured by monitoring the static deflection of the AFM cantilever. The introduction of dynamic AFM with an oscillating cantilever brought various improvements, such as much lower measurement back action which greatly reduced damage to soft samples while imaging. In addition, the ability to measure the phase lag between the cantilever response and the exciting force, opened a new information channel to record while scanning. These \"phase images\" enabled compositional mapping of surfaces with dynamic AFM. The standard interpretation relates the measured phase lag to the energy dissipation resulting from the tip-sample interaction [2].

However, the introduction of dynamic AFM with an oscillating cantilever improved measurement accuracy and reduced damage to soft samples. The ability to measure phase lag between the cantilever response and the exciting force opened a new information channel, enabling compositional mapping of surfaces. The standard interpretation links the measured phase lag to energy dissipation from the tip-sample interaction.",

It has been realized that the higher harmonics of the tip-motion carry valuable information about the tip-sample interaction. Each higher harmonic represents two new information channels (amplitude and phase) that can be recorded while scanning. Higher harmonic amplitudes and phases have been used for imaging both under ambient conditions and in liquids [7; 8; 9]. With a sufficient number of these information channels, a quantitative reconstruction of the tip-sample force is possible without measuring amplitude-distance curves [10; 11]. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for higher harmonics measurements is usually very poor because the harmonics are in general not located at a cantilever resonance. Various efforts have been made to improve the signal detection, for example by modifying the cantilever design [12].question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

Each IMP frequency is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency \\(\\Delta f\\). The phase of each IMP can be related to the phase of a signal at \\(\\Delta f\\).

In all the FeAs-based parent compounds, there is a structural phase transition in the temperature range 100-200 K, and a stripe-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering associated with Fe ions accompanying the structural transition [12; 13; 14]. Various chemical doping approaches can suppress the structural transition and AFM order, and high-\\(T_{c}\\) superconductivity consequently appears. Meanwhile, low-\\(T_{c}\\) superconductivity has been observed in undoped FeP-based [1] and NiAs(P)-based [8; 15] compounds with similar layered structure, but there is neither structural transition nor AFM ordering associated with Fe(Ni) ions in these compounds. This result implies that there is a relationship between structural transition/AFM ordering and high-\\(T_{c}\\) superconductivity. Theoretically, the origin of the AFM order is still controversial. There are two different physical pictures. One suggests that the AFM order is a spin density wave (SDW) which is driven by Fermi surface nesting between the electron pockets at M point and hole pockets at \\(\\Gamma\\) point based on band structural calculations [12; 16]. The other suggests that the AFM order stems from the short range magnetic exchange coupling between local moments [17; 18; 19; 20]. However, regardless of the origin of the AFM ordering, the theories suggest that the superconductivity is tied to the magnetism in the FeAs-based materials [16; 17; 20; 21]. The investigation on the structural properties and AFM ordering of the parent compounds can shed light on the mechanism of high-\\(T_{c}\\) superconductivity.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

        "question": "The structural and magnetic transitions in the FeAs-based parent compounds are deeply connected. For the first discovered 1111 type systems, neutron scattering studies on the \\(R\\)FeAsO (\\(R\\) = La, Ce, Nd, and Sm) samples have found that the structural phase transition occurs first as temperature decreases, and then magnetic ordering associated with Fe ions follows [13; 22], in contrast to the case in 122-type systems where both structural transition and AFM order occur at the same temperature [14]. Recent report on isotope effect also shows positive isotope effect on both \\(T_{c}\\) and AFM ordering temperature [23]. Some theoretic studies proposed that the structural transition is directly driven by the AFM order [17; 19; 24]. In particular, a theory based on a Heisenberg-type local moment exchange model suggests that the structural transition can be driven by a nematic Ising magnetic order due to the presence of intrinsic magnetic frustration [19]. The theory [19] predicts that the difference between the structural and magnetic transition temperatures is controlled by the magnetic coupling between layers: the difference becomes larger when the coupling is weakened. Recent neutron experiment results in 4% Ni-doped BaFe\\({}_{2}\\)As\\({}_{2}\\) have supported this prediction [25].question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

In 1111 type systems, the structural phase transition occurs before magnetic ordering, whereas in 122-type systems, both transitions occur at the same temperature.

The structural transition may be driven by the AFM order, specifically through a nematic Ising magnetic order caused by intrinsic magnetic frustration.

        "question": "Plume splitting of a laser produced plasma has been studied using Langmuir probes [15; 19; 20; 22] and also by a fast imaging technique [23; 24; 25]. Briefly, ablation into ambient gases results in shock waves and expansion fronts propagating through the background gases. Once occurring the splitting of the plasma plume, there is an energetic component that propagates with a free expansion velocity and a second one that is slowed down, depending on the pressure of the background gas. Therefore, the ions located at the front of the plasma acquire the largest energy during hydrodynamic acceleration and the interaction time for recombination is very much reduced. On the other hand, the ions located in the inner plume layers are less energetic. They remain much longer in the denser state, which may be subjected to strong recombination. Recently, Kushwaha and Thareja performed an elegant work where the splitting of a carbon plasma plume expanding in a nitrogen gas atmosphere was recored using a time resolved spectroscopy imaging technique [26]. They found that, at early stages of the plume expansion, the outer plume (energetic) yields a spectroscopic emission dominated by CI and CII species, while for the inner plume the spectrum was almost entirely dominated by C\\({}_{2}\\) and CN band line emission. Therefore the outer plume, under proper conditions, might be the right ambient for clustering followed by subsequent nanoparticle formation and film growth [27].question: please summerize this text within 150 words",
        "answer": "The text discusses the splitting of a plasma plume created by laser ablation into ambient gases. The splitting results in an outer energetic component and an inner slower component, affecting the ions' energy levels and recombination processes. Studies on carbon plasma plume splitting in a nitrogen atmosphere revealed differences in spectral emissions between the outer and inner plume, suggesting the potential for nanoparticle formation and film growth in the outer plume.",

        "question": "Reversible absorption and desorption at reasonable temperatures was first accomplished by Bogdanovic and Schwickardi in 1997 by adding a few percent titanium. Bogdanovic and Schwickardi (1997) The mechanism of this kinetic improvement has remained controversial. Recent first-principles calculations suggest that titanium may play a role as an electronically active impurity, promoting the diffusion of hydrogen. Bogdanovic and Schwickardi (1997) A number of kinetic experiments have been performed on the above reactions, Bogdanovic and Schwickardi (1997); Schwickardi (1997); Schwickardi (1997); Schwickardi and Schwickardi (1997); Schwickardi (1997) and these studies are in reasonable agreement with regards to the reported activation energy of desorption. Desorption of hydrogen and decomposition of NaAlH\\({}_{4}\\) requires not only mass transport of hydrogen but also of aluminum and/or sodium. Schwickardi (1998) This process is likely to be mediated by native defects. Lohstroh and Fichtner suggested that desorption from NaAlH\\({}_{4}\\) is rate-limited by diffusion. Lohstroh and Fichtner (1997) Diffusion of native defects was recently approached by Gunaydin _et al._ through first-principles methods. Gunaydin et al.

The reason for the complications is that these defects can be thought of as complexes between more elementary native point defects, as discussed in Sec. III. In this view, however, one can also estimate a lower bound for the migration energies of these complexes by taking the higher of the migration barriers of the constituent defects. For instance, H\\({}_{i}^{+}\\) can be considered as a complex of \\(V_{\\rm H}^{+}\\) and (H\\({}_{2}\\))\\({}_{i}\\), suggesting that its migration barrier will be at least 0.26 eV, the value for \\(V_{\\rm H}^{+}\\). This estimate should be a lower limit for the migration barrier of the complex, since it assumes that during the migration process the complex remains fully bound. If during migration (partial) breaking of the complex occurs, then an energy cost needs to be paid that would increase the value of the barrier.

        "question": "This suggested mechanism also immediately provides an explanation for the observed effect of Ti (or other transition metals), following the arguments in Ref. [2]. Ti acts as an electrically active dopant that shifts the Fermi level. Shifts of the Fermi level will always lead to a lowering of the formation energy of the hydrogen-related defects. [2] For purposes of illustration, consider an upward shift in the Fermi level, such as would be introduced by Ti. [2] Figure 2 shows that if the magnitude of this shift exceeds a few 0.1 eV, it becomes energetically more favorable for the vacancy to be present in the negative charge state rather than the positive charge state. The H\\({}_{i}^{-}\\)-\\(V_{\\rm H}^{-}\\) Frenkel pair will then be lower in energy than the H\\({}_{i}^{-}\\)-\\(V_{\\rm H}^{+}\\) pair. To illustrate the effect of a shift in Fermi level, consider the example given in Ref.

        "question": "The theory and methods of obtaining the electrical signals from the local electron states are proposed based on the knowledge of AES [9-11]. AES stems from the special transition process involving two electrons: the Auger electron is emitted by the energy given to the system from the spontaneous transition of the first electron. The Auger spectrum enables the probing of the electron states of specific atoms in complex systems. The valence band (VB) Auger spectrum (e.g., KVV) can be expressed by the combination of the convolutions of valence electron densities of states (DOS) [12]:question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

This demonstrates that any changes of the local environment, either chemical or physical, will have their direct or indirect signatures in the Auger spectral lineshape.

        "question": "According to the above, at least two parts of the electrical information could have been enfolded in the Auger spectrum, i.e., the electric field and the electron density. Here we will discuss the principles of obtaining the relation between these two electrical quantities and the Auger spectral lineshape. Then, the practical measurement techniques can be established by these principles. As we know, the Auger electron has a fixed kinetic energy. When the additional electric field is applied, the kinetic energy of Auger electrons is changed and consequently, this change will result in the energy shift of Auger peak. Therefore, the Auger spectral shift directly represents the magnitude and direction of the local electric field. This relation will be used to establish the electric field detection by the Auger electron probe. For the latter, the description of electron density in the Auger spectrum will be discussed below. In Eq. (1), one can see that the VB Auger peak consists of the convolution integral of electron DOS's, thereby the peak intensity is associated with the electron density around the corresponding atoms. In order to quantify the relation between the peak height and the electron density, Al\\({}_{x}\\)Ga\\({}_{I\\text{-}x}\\)N samples with different Al mole fractions, up to 53 %, were prepared and systematically measured and _ab initio_ calculations performed on the same systems [13-15].question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

        "question": "Figure 1 shows the N KVV Auger lines for different Al compositions. The three peaks N\\({}_{pp}\\), N\\({}_{sp}\\) and N\\({}_{ss}\\) correspond to the convolution terms of _s_- and _p_-state DOS. One can see that the N\\({}_{pp}\\) height appears proportional to the Al mole fraction. This can be explained by the local electron concentration around N atoms as a function of the Al mole fraction. The calculated difference of charge density between the Al-N and Ga-N bonds are shown in the inset of figure 1. It can be seen that the Al-N bond has a stronger polarity than the Ga-N bond has and thus, the higher electron density around N occurs in the Al-N bond. This indicates that the higher composition of Al-N bonds will lead to higher average electron density around N atoms. By using Eq. (1), we find that the higher electron density will give rise to a larger N\\({}_{pp}\\) height. Consequently, the quanttive relation between the N\\({}_{pp}\\) height and local electron concentration of nitrogen atoms can be determined. Note that the peak height ratio N\\({}_{pp}\\)/N\\({}_{sp}\\) will be used for our analysis instead of the N\\({}_{pp}\\) height.

First of all, because of the important phenomenon of heterointerface, compositional diffusion [22; 23], the location and thickness of the interfacial region should carefully determined. For this purpose, the secondary electron imaging and elemental mapping were carried out on the cross-section of the sample by AES, as shown in figure 4a-c. The heterointerfaces can be explicitly distinguished. The Al and Ga elements undergo an inter-diffusion across the heterointerface and a chemically gradient nanointerfacial region forms. More refined examination of the chemical compositions was obtained by the elemental profiling, as shown in figure 4d. Taking into account the effect of the escape depth and the Ar\\({}^{+}\\) ion energy [22], the inter-diffusion length across the heterointerface is determined to be 4.0 nm.

        "question": "The intrinsic charge concentrations at the GaN/Al\\({}_{0.23}\\)Ga\\({}_{0.77}\\)N/GaN nanointerfaces were measured (figure 5).

The spatial distribution of the sheet charges is closely related to the configuration of the diffused nanointerface. These charges congregate mainly in the nanointerfacial region and the maximal concentration appears sharply at the center of the gradient interfacial region. This indicates that the diffused nanointerface plays an important role in accommodating the polar charges. The width and the chemical gradient of the interfacial region are the crucial parameters influencing the charge distribution. By integrating over the entire nanointerfacial range, the total charge concentration covering the region of the interface 1 is -15.8 e/nm\\({}^{2}\\).

It distributes symmetrically across the gradient region and the main part of the charges is confined in the nanointerfacial region. Because this electrical detection is free from interferences by external fields, the charge concentration obtained here directly reveals the behavior of the intrinsic polarization charges +\\(\\sigma_{p}\\). This type of charge has been widely discussed [6; 24; 25], but is rarely detectable by conventional techniques. By the charge-neutrality constraint, one can obtain the corresponding polarization charge concentration at the topmost nanointerface: -\\(\\sigma_{p}\\) = -4.4 e/nm\\({}^{2}\\). This value agrees well with the theoretical prediction of the same order, but with higher spatial accuracy than that by C-V profile measurement [25]. Thus, the ratio of \\(\\sigma_{s}\\)/\\(\\sigma_{p}\\) at the first nanointerface is 2.6. The opposite sign of the polar charges at two interfaces is due to the the arrangement of the GaN and AlGaN heterolayers along the [0001] direction. On the other hand, in the GaN/AlGaN/GaN heterostructure of GaN-based high-power transistor, two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) has been observed near the second interface [20]. However, the sign of the 2DEG is negative, which is opposite to what we observed at the interface 2.

In our approach, we attempted to measure the variation of local electric field and thereby, rebuilt the actual energy-band configurations. The longitudinal profile of the local electric field in the GaN/Al\\({}_{0.23}\\)Ga\\({}_{0.77}\\)N/GaN across two nanointerfaces was carried out and is shown in figure 6. By the mark-shift technique [10], the Ga LMM peak shift was used to measure the direction and magnitude of the electric field. One can observe in figure 6 that a negative electric potential exists at the first interface whereas a positive electric potential appears at the second interface.

Then by putting the local electric fields on the flat band, the actual configurations of the conduction band (CB) and VB are rebuilt, as shown in figure 7. The local electric fields introduce additional bending on the energy-band configurations and potential wells form at the nanointerfacial regions. In general, the potential well in CB acts as an electron trap while the VB well as a hole trap (positive charges). In this case, one can see that the CB well appears at the second nanointerface and covers the gradient region. The well width is well consistent with the distribution width of \\(+\\sigma_{p}\\). As shown in figure 7, this CB well traps the free electrons to form the layer of 2DEG.

This is much less compared to other already established photovoltaic power conversion techniques which have an efficiency above 10% or even above 20% for crystalline silicon cells. Nevertheless OPV devices have several advantages like the possibility of low-cost production [3], room temperature processing and thin film structures. The latter two make it possible to use flexible substrates and thus the production of flexible solar cells. This leads to low-cost, flexible and transportable energy generators. Our research focuses on the influence of optical and electrical parameters on device performance.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

        "question": "Numerical models for organic BHJ devices provide insight into operating mechanisms and allow for device structure optimization. The simulation of OPV devices can be separated into two parts, firstly there is the incoupling of light into a multilayer structure and secondly the extraction of charges which needs an electrical model. The absorption of light within the multilayer structure is a crucial process and thus one of the main areas of numerical simulations. Harrison et al. [4] used analytical models and compared them to measured photocurrent action spectra. Later a transfer matrix formalism has been used by Petterson et al. [5] to calculate the absorbed optical energy within the multilayer structure. This formalism is widely used to optimize layer structures for single junction [6] as well as tandem cells [7]. Though optical models are very reliable they are only able to give an upper limit of the achievable photocurrent. Therefore electrical models have been developed to study charge generation and transport losses in planar heterojunction [8] as well as BHJ devices [9; 10; 11; 12]. These models differ in their choice of ingredients, definition of the boundary conditions as well as in their methods to solve the drift-diffusion equations. Coupled opto-electronic models have been introduced by Kirchartz et al. [13], Lacic et al. [14] and Kotlarski et al. [15], where they connected a drift-diffusion solver with an optical thin-film simulator.

Therefore an OPV is an optically coherent device. This gives rise to interference effects inside the device which can be exploited to increase the maximum photocurrent by carefully tuning the thicknesses of the individual layers [20][5][10]. An approach to find the optimal layer thicknesses from an optical point of view is to calculate the electromagnetic field inside the multilayer stack using a transfer matrix formalism.

        "question": "There is a debate on the nature of the open-circuit voltage V\\({}_{oc}\\) in OPVs and currently there are several alternative explanations. There is evidence, that the open-circuit voltage depends on the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) difference of the donor and acceptor molecules at the interface [38][39]. Recently, this mechanism has been looked at in more detail and a linear dependence of the V\\({}_{oc}\\) on the energy of the charge-transfer absorption has been found [40]. The open-circuit voltage also depends on the work-function of the electrodes [41]. This influence seems to be more pronounced in bulk heterojunction than in planar heterojunction device setups [42]. Furthermore the open-circuit voltage was observed to be intensity and temperature dependent [43]. This complex behavior is challenging for the simulation of these devices, because there is not a single theory which is capable of describing all of those dependencies. The approach used here assumes that every device has a built-in voltage V\\({}_{bi}\\) which is derived from the difference in the work functions of the two electrodes. This is then used to calculate the effectively applied voltage V\\({}_{eff}\\). The electric field distribution inside the device is obtained through integration of the Poisson equation (cf. Eq. (7)) using the effective bias V\\({}_{eff}\\) as a constraint to determine the integration constant,question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

        "question": "For all the measured short-circuit current points in figure 4 a current-voltage curve was measured as well. An analysis of the influence of the device thickness on the current-voltage curve is performed for three representative thicknesses which is shown in figure 9. The short-circuit current as well as the open-circuit voltage depend on the amount of the absorbed photons. Therefore to compare the current-voltage curves for different thicknesses the short-circuit current as well as the open-circuit voltage need to be normalized to exclude optical effects. The comparison in figure 9 shows, that the shape of the experimental current-voltage curve does not change for different thicknesses of the active layers. In contrast the simulated current-voltage curves show a clear dependence of the shape on the device thickness. This indicates that in the fourth quadrant the influence of the electric field on dissociation efficiency and thus recombination losses is overestimated in the device model presented here. A possible explanation for this discrepancy might be the nature of the Onsager -Braun dissociation mechanism, which does not consider energetic disorder. Though much used, the Onsager-Braun model is not necessarily the best physical description of charge separation and more refined models have been developed. For instance Wojcik et al. [47] have derived an extended model based on the Onsager theory which leads to a weaker field dependence.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

Up to now, only DC characteristics (e.g. current-voltage curves) were used to access electron transport through the monolayers, and especially to emphasize the role of the molecule-electrode interface [12, 13, 14]. The dynamic electron transport properties in molecular junctions have only been studied byinelastic electron spectroscopy to characterize the interaction between electrons and the molecular vibrations in the infra-red region (\\(>\\)10\\({}^{12}\\) Hz).[15, 16, 17] However, other relaxation phenomena in the intermediate frequency range (1 - 10\\({}^{6}\\) Hz) are also important to assess the molecular organization and the presence of defect in the monolayers. Permanent molecular dipoles tend to relax to be oriented with the electric field direction.[18] Their dynamics is expected to depend on the molecular packing and organization (e.g. presence of domains and clusters) in the monolayers. We note that dynamic relaxations were previously characterized for alkyl monolayers grafted on porous glass[19] and on thick-oxide using a lateral electrode configurations.[20] These authors were able to distinguish the dipole relaxation coming from the bottom and top of the organic monolayers[19] and to follow the dependance of these dipole relaxation as a function of the monolayer density.[20] At lower frequency (\\(<1\\) kHz), other phenomena regrouped under the name \"interfacial polarization\" have to be considered.

These two types of samples are selected (after DC current-voltage measurements) from the same batch as a result of the inherent dispersion already observed with such a chemical approach. Sample C: a 2 nm thick oxide was thermally grown on n-type doped (1-3x10-3 \\(\\Omega\\).cm) Si(100) in dry 0\\({}_{2}\\) at 720\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C and chemically thinned to 0.6 nm at 0.64 A/min by a HF(0.1%)/HCl(2.5%) solution. A monolayer of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) -see Fig. 2- was formed by reacting in solution the freshly prepared oxide surface with 10-3 M of OTS in a mixture of hexadecane/CCl\\({}_{4}\\) as reported elsewhere [25, 26]. In that case the alkyl chain is bonded to the substrate through siloxane (Si-O-Si) bonds. The quality of the monolayers was assessed by spectroscopic ellipsometry and water contact angle measurements (table 1). We selected only monolayers with a water contact angle larger than 110\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and a thickness close to _docos\\(\\theta\\)_ (within \\(\\pm\\) 3 A) where _d\\({}_{\\theta}\\)_ is the expected length of the molecule in its all-trans conformation and \\(\\theta\\) is the tilt angle between the long axe of the molecule and the normal to the surface (\\(\\sim\\) 15\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\sim\\) 30\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for OTS on oxidized Si and OD on Si:H, respectively).[27, 28] We also prepared a control experiment sample (no organic monolayer) with a 3 nm thick thermal oxide using the same oxidation process as for sample C (dry O\\({}_{2}\\) at 720\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C). A 50 nm thick aluminium contact pads with different surface areas between 9x10\\({}^{-4}\\) cm\\({}^{2}\\) and 4x10\\({}^{-2}\\) cm\\({}^{2}\\) were vacuum (10\\({}^{-7}\\) Torr) evaporated at 3 A/s on top of the alkyl chains, or they were contacted with a hanging Hg drop. In case of evaporated metal electrodes, the devices were contacted with a micro-manipulator probe station (Suss Microtec PM-5) placed inside a glove box (MBRAUN) with a strictly controlled nitrogen ambient (less than 1 ppm of water vapor and oxygen). The hanging naked Hg drop was formed using a controlled growth mercury electrode system (BAS) in a glove box, the sample was placed on an elevator stage and put into contact by moving it upward. The junction size was estimated by measuring the Hg drop profile by a calibrated USB webcam. The Hg drop contact method has been demonstrated to be shortage free and reproducible.[11, 29, 30] All electrical measurements were conducted in dark. Some OTS samples were submitted to a thermal annealing at 200\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in N\\({}_{2}\\) for 1 hour. We measured about 20 samples of each type to assess the dispersion of the junctions parameters, the curves shown in the figures are representative of the average behavior.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

        "question": "The **figures 3 and 4** show \\(C\\)' and \\(C\\)'' for two representative samples hereafter denoted as samples A and B. They are both made of OD on Si but differ by their level of measured DC tunnel current (see above, section II.A). We distinguish 3 contributions corresponding to peaks in the dielectric loss \\(C\\)'' and steps and plateaus in the capacitance \\(C\\)'. The first peak in \\(C\\)'' (filled in yellow) corresponds to interfacial relaxations and the second peak (in blue) to molecular relaxations. The contribution of the DC tunnel conductance is filled in green (it follows a _1/f_ behavior, _Gr/o_ contribution in eq. (3)). In all curves, we observe in the high frequency part an increase of both \\(C\\)' and \\(C\\)'', which is due to a parasitic inductance (see section II.B). The first peak is well fitted with the Debye model [33] describing a set of identical non-interacting defects whose dynamics is reduced to tunneling between two minimal configurations (see section III on theory). It can be linked to the bias dependent _1/f_ noise increase due to a peaked density of defect previously reported for this device. [21] The amplitude of this peak varies from device to device: the interfacial relaxation contribution is relatively weak for sample A and strong for sample B. We note an increase of the \\(C\\)'' peak and the \\(C\\)'' plateau by about 30 times. This increase is strongly related with an increase in the DC tunnel conductance \\(G_{T}\\) by 3 orders of magnitude. Device B was selected (see section II.A) to illustrate this point. The second peak was fitted with a Dissado-Hill expression[35] (see section III). The imaginary part of this phenomenological expression shows fractional power laws, \\(\\omega^{m}\\) and \\(\\omega^{n-l}\\), in the pre and post peak region, respectively. Such behaviors are the signature of strongly constrained dynamic of relaxation due to interaction between the relaxing quantities and their environment. The \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) exponents have been related by Dissado and Hill to structural characteristics. The dipolar relaxation contributions to \\(C\\)' and \\(C\\)'' are similar for samples A and B, which means that they have a similar molecular organization and packing. Since the nature and technology used to form the top contact on the monolayer can strongly influence and even degrade the electronic properties of the molecular junction[36, 11], we also tested samples A and B using a hanging Hg drop. The results (Fig 4) are almost similar as for the evaporated Al electrode.

This hypothesis can be considered for several reasons: (i) we have already pointed out the link between interface-trap assisted tunneling current and low frequency noise in these molecular junctions [21], considering traps energetically localized in the HOMO-LUMO gap of the alkyl monolayers; (ii) interface traps in other inorganic tunnel barrier usually respond in this frequency range [31]. We note, however, that we did not observe (Fig. 6) a significant interfacial relaxation peak in this frequency range for a reference sample (i.e. a 3 nm thick thermal oxide without any molecular monolayer, see section II.A), which means that the observed peaks are due to some defects related to the organic monolayer and not at the Si/SiO\\({}_{2}\\) interface, nor buried in the SiO\\({}_{2}\\) layer. The nature, origin, of which remains to be discovered. One possible origin should be interface defects at the molecule-substrate interface (e.g. dangling or distorted bonds) [38, 39]. Because covalently bonded organic monolayers are organized in domains with grain boundaries and they present also pinholes, another possible origin could be surface states coming from substrate surface atoms belonging to these regions where molecules are absent. It has been previously observed and calculated that these pinholes can play an important role to determine the overall electrical behavior of the monolayer devices [40]. \\({}^{41}\\) We can note that the fact that the first contribution is very close to a Debye response is attributed to a distribution of defects with a time constant response strongly peaked around the frequency \\(f_{l}\\): one type of defects seems to dominate the dielectric response in this frequency range.

The amplitudes of the two local permanent dipoles may be roughly estimated by semi-empirical calculations between 0.5 and 1 D (MOPAC software)[42]. We did the calculation by considering a single molecule attached to a silicon cluster (88 Si atoms, see Fig. 2-c). These values are clearly an overestimation since screening effects from the metallic electrodes and interactions between molecules have not been considered. In the case of OTS on oxidized silicon, the dipole is a little bit larger (1.5-2 D) since the Si-O bond is more polar than the Si-C bond. The presence of these permanent dipoles, even small dipoles, should be sufficient to give sizable dielectric polarization but, in our case, a thin electrode is deposited on top of the monolayer. As a result most of the molecules are strongly constraint and can hardly react to an electric field: they can be considered as inactive during the polarization process. However, we assume that some molecules - or at least segments of some molecules - are more free. They may be preferentially located at (or near) some structural defects of the monolayer. The local permanent dipoles of those molecules are then mobile, or partially mobile, and are consequently able to follow the applied electric field. They give the most important contribution to the dipolar polarization. Moreover, when they are reoriented by the applied field they affect also the rest of the monolayer due to the van der Waals type of interaction that exist between molecules. The reorientation of the mobile dipoles and the disturbance that these motions induce in the surrounding of the mobile dipoles are both responsible for the observed dielectric susceptibility. In this picture, the details of the dielectric relaxation are due to the interaction of the active dipole with the harmonic modes of the monolayer. They should be sensitive to the way the monolayer mechanically reacts to the local constraints caused by the reorientation of the active dipoles. The measured response is a system average which contains elements both from the active dipoles and from the mechanical interaction of these dipoles with the rest of the structure. The basic case is OTS SAM (sample C). \\(m\\) = 0.1 - 0.2 and \\(n\\) = 0.8 - 0.9 exponents are close to the flat loss limit (\\(m\\) = 0 and \\(n\\) = 1). These are typical values for imperfectly crystallized materials and it is well-known that OTS SAM are polycrystalline with a short-range order (coherence length of 70 A from X-ray grazing angle diffraction).[43] We estimate (MOPAC software)[42] the small dipole at the foot of the molecule in the range 0.5-2 D (depending on the OD or OTS samples, see above) when the alkyl chain is in all-trans conformation and a little higher, if we include a gauche-defect somewhere in the chain conformation. Such a local dipole has been also suggested to explain the dielectric loss measurements done on alkyl chains grafted on porous glass[19] and thick-oxide.[20] A more quantitative comparison of the peak amplitude and frequency remains difficult given the wide differences in the experimental conditions (low temperatures and disordered, low packing, monolayers in their cases, room temperature and highly-packed, better-ordered, monolayer in our case) and differences in the sample geometries (porous glass and planar electrodes for the quoted works, vertical structure with a sandwiched monolayer here).question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

The interfacial relaxation is related to defects found in Si/SAM or Si/SiO\\({}_{2}\\)/SAM molecular junctions (not in Si/SiO\\({}_{2}\\)). They are located at the bottom of the SAM and at energy close to the conduction band edge of the silicon. Depending on their density, DC electrical characteristics are more or less affected.

Optical excitation of graphene can result in the interband population inversion and negative real part of the dynamic conductivity of a graphene layer \\(\\sigma_{\\omega}\\) in the THz range of frequencies [7; 8; 9]. The negativity of the real part of the dynamic conductivity implies that the interband emission of photons with the energy \\(\\hbar\\omega\\), where \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck constant, prevail over the intraband (Drude) absorption. If the THz photon losses in the resonant cavity are sufficiently small, the THz lasing can be realized in graphene-based devices with optical pumping [10; 11]. In Refs. [10; 11], the optically pumped THz lasers with a Fabri-Perot resonator were considered. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the THz lasers based on multiple-graphene-layer (MGL) structures with a metal slot-line waveguide (SLW) or a dielectric waveguide (DW) pumped by optical radiation. The specific features of characteristics of the MGL-based lasers under consideration are associated with the frequency dependences of the absorption in the waveguides and the gain-overlap factor, which is sensitive to the spatial distribution of the THz electric field. As show in the following, the characteristics of the lasers with SLW and DW are fairly similar, so that we will mainly focus on the device with SLW. This in part because the structures with SLW exhibit somewhat better confinement and can be used not only for MGL-based lasers with optical pumping but also in MGL-based injection lasers with lateral p-i-n junctions (both electrically induced [12; 13; 14] and formed by pertinent doping of MGL structure).question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

The characteristics of these lasers are influenced by the frequency dependence of absorption in the waveguides and the spatial distribution of the terahertz electric field.

This is the case for specific heat spectroscopy based on thermal diffusion into a thick sample from a thin metallic film that serves simultaneously as heater and thermometer[37; 44; 46] or similarly for the study of a heating resistor where the third harmonics is related to its electrothermal parameters[45; 35]. The bridge technique has also been used to measure the nonlinear inductive response of a superconducting film[25], the nonlinear behaviour of power piezoceramic materials[10], etc. The bridge techniques evoked above cannot be used for our purpose because the balancing of the bridge at the fundamental frequency would be lost at the third harmonics: The strong frequency dependence of our sample impedance can hardly be mimicked by a combination of resistors and capacitors in the second arm.

A basic feature of glassforming supercooled liquids is the spectacular increase of the characteristic relaxation time \\(\\tau_{\\alpha}(T)\\) as \\(T\\) decreases towards \\(T_{g}\\). \\(T_{g}\\) is conventionally defined by \\(\\tau_{\\alpha}(T_{g})\\simeq 100\\) s. \\(\\tau_{\\alpha}\\) is often obtained from dielectric spectroscopy[48; 50; 53]. Fig. 1 shows an example of linear dielectric susceptibility \\(\\chi_{1}(\\omega)\\) measurement for glycerol (C\\({}_{3}\\)O\\({}_{3}\\)H\\({}_{8}\\), \\(T_{g}\\simeq 190\\) K) at \\(T=211.8\\) K. The imaginary part \\(Im(\\chi_{1})\\) is maximum, and the real part \\(Re(\\chi_{1})\\) is approximately half its maximum plateau for \\(\\omega_{\\alpha}=2\\pi/\\tau_{\\alpha}\\). At present, the fast decrease of \\(\\omega_{\\alpha}\\) with \\(T\\) has not received a unique microscopic physical interpretation, but a seminal concept [54; 55] is that of cooperative effects: When \\(T_{g}\\) is approached, molecules belonging to larger and larger regions (called dynamical heterogeneities, DH) should move in a correlated way to allow relaxation. Correlation lengths probing such cooperative effects have been extracted experimentally, leading to length scales estimates of \\(4-12\\) molecular diameters [47; 56; 57; 58; 59; 60; 61]. However these experiments were not able to test the expected increase of the correlation length as \\(T\\) decreases towards \\(T_{g}\\) which is of fundamental interest. For spin glasses the increase of the correlation length close to the critical temperature is associated to the divergence of \\(\\chi_{i}\\) (\\(i\\geq 3\\))[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]. This suggests to investigate \\(\\chi_{i}(T)\\) (\\(i\\geq 3\\)) close to the structural glass transition, although no divergence is expected. Up to very recently, the nonlinear susceptibility \\(\\chi_{3}(\\omega)\\) had never been measured in these systems (see however [41; 42; 62]) contrary to spin glasses.

        "question": "Despite this important feature, we shall see now that the two sources bridge does not reach the required resolution of \\(|I(3\\omega)/I(\\omega)|\\simeq 1\\times 10^{-7}\\). This comes from the fact that the two sources, as any active electronic device, have a non-zero harmonic distortion: They generate \\(V_{s,1}(3\\omega)\\) and \\(V_{s,2}(3\\omega)\\) voltages in addition to \\(V_{s,1}(\\omega)\\) and \\(V_{s,2}(\\omega)\\). Thus a possible remaining problem is the contribution of \\(V_{s,1}(3\\omega)\\) and \\(V_{s,2}(3\\omega)\\) to \\(V_{A}(3\\omega)\\). To reduce it, we low-pass filtered the sources outputs with a dual channel six poles elliptic active filter, with a corner frequency \\(f_{c}\\) chosen close to the working frequency \\(\\omega/2\\pi\\). The filter damps the \\(3\\omega\\) component of the incoming signal, while it does not affect the \\(1\\omega\\) component. We verified that this filtering reduced significantly the harmonics magnitude. Fig. 3 shows the measured \\(V_{A}(3\\omega)\\) for the two sources bridge at \\(\\omega=\\omega_{\\alpha}\\). The results are the same for the thin and the thick sample of setup A (\\(L_{thin}=30\\)\\(\\mu\\)m and \\(L_{thick}=60\\)\\(\\mu\\)m), which shows that the measured signals do not come from the samples. Indeed, Eq. 8 gives a current \\(|I(3\\omega)|\\) eight times larger for the thin sample than for the thick one. We took \\(R\\simeq 0.084\\,|Z(\\omega)|\\) in order to keep similar values of \\(V_{s,1}(\\omega)\\) and \\(V_{s,2}(\\omega)\\) for the thin and the thick sample measurements, thus, from Eq. 13, the expected ratio of \\(V_{A}(3\\omega)\\) for the two samples is 4, instead of the \"no change\" result of Fig. 3. Thus we conclude that the third harmonics generated by the voltage sources are responsible for the results of Fig. 3.

To mitigate this issue, low-pass filtering is applied to reduce the magnitude of the harmonics. The measurements of \\(V_{A}(3\\omega)\\) for thin and thick samples show a discrepancy, which is attributed to the third harmonics generated by the voltage sources.

As explained above, \\(V_{s}(3\\omega)\\) was measured by using the twin-T notch filter method with the sample replaced by a resistor. Its value depends on \\(\\omega\\) and \\(V_{s}\\), but we found that its contribution to \\(V_{m}(3\\omega)\\) remained much smaller than the physical contribution for the two samples bridge, e.g. for \\(T\\) = 210.2 K and \\(\\omega/(2\\pi)\\) = 43.76 Hz, it is 3 orders of magnitude below. The contribution of the lockin was negligible because the equilibration of the bridge led to \\(V_{m}(\\omega)\\) values below 1 mV: Fig. 2 shows that the resulting third harmonics is well below 40 nV, a negligible value with respect to the measured \\(V_{m}(3\\omega)\\) of a few \\(\\mu\\)V.

        "question": "The equilibration (Eq. 17) of the two-sample bridge is realized by tuning \\(z_{thin}\\) and \\(z_{thick}\\) (two resistors in our case) in series with the two impedances of the samples, \\(Z_{thin}\\) and (see section IV and the insets of Figs. 6,7). This is time consuming because in order to keep the ratio \\(r_{thin}/\\left|Z_{thin}(1\\omega)\\right|=r_{thick}/\\left|Z_{thick}(1\\omega)\\right|\\) at its optimum value, it has to be done for each temperature or frequency change. A possible solution is a _four_ samples bridge: In such a device, the two sample capacitors of different thicknesses are kept, but the two impedances \\(z_{thin}\\) and \\(z_{thick}\\) are replaced by two other sample capacitors. Thus, neither the equilibration, nor the ratio of impedances in each arm depend on \\(T\\) or \\(\\omega\\). The first (resp. second) arm of a four sample bridge would contain sample 1 (resp. 2) connected to the source and sample 3 (resp. 4) connected to the ground. The thicknesses are \\(L_{i}\\) (\\(i\\) = 1,4) and the electrode surfaces \\(S_{i}\\) (\\(i\\) = 1,4). If the surfaces are the same in an arm (\\(S_{1}\\) = \\(S_{3}\\) or \\(S_{2}\\) = \\(S_{4}\\)), the contribution of the two physical currents (\\(I_{1}(3\\omega)\\) and \\(I_{3}(3\\omega)\\), or \\(I_{2}(3\\omega)\\) and \\(I_{4}(3\\omega)\\)) to the measured \\(3\\omega\\) voltage \\(V_{m,sample}(3\\omega)\\) is zero. This is because the electric field at 1\\(\\omega\\) in the two capacitors in an arm would be the same: The different thicknesses (see Eq. 8) are compensated by the voltage division between the two capacitors. Thus \\(S_{1}\\neq S_{3}\\) and \\(S_{2}\\)\\(\\neq S_{4}\\) are needed. The balancing condition \\(Z_{1}Z_{4}=Z_{2}Z_{3}\\) leads to \\(L_{1}L_{4}S_{2}S_{3}=L_{2}L_{3}S_{1}S_{4}\\).

The nonlinear part of this response is present in its harmonics. Their measurement is a hard task for weak nonlinear responses because the electronic devices used for the excitation and for the measurement are always non linear at a certain level. Our experiment, devoted to the measurement of the nonlinear response of dielectric supercooled liquids, measures the third harmonics component of the polarization when an electric field is applied to a sample layer in a plane capacitor. It consists in measuring a current \\(I(3\\omega)\\) at a frequency three (possibly five, etc.) times that of the linear response \\(I(\\omega)\\) when a voltage \\(V_{s}(\\omega)\\) is applied to the capacitor. Both the lock-in amplifier and the voltage source yield a third harmonics component which precludes measuring the nonlinear response in a simple experiment such as this presented in section III.2. To overcome this problem, we have used a method based on a bridge with two capacitors of different thicknesses. We have shown that such a device strongly reduces the two spurious third harmonics component of the measured signal: That of the voltage source and that of the lock-in amplifier. This \"two-sample\" bridge, used with a low distortion voltage source allowed to reach our goal of a sensitivity better than \\(10^{-7}\\) and to realize our first measurements of the nonlinear response of a supercooled liquid close to the glass transition.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

        "question": "Ferrous alloys are well known for a wide variety of anomalous structural and magnetic properties. Around 1185 K, bulk iron undergoes a structural transition from a face centered cubic (fcc) high-temperature phase to a low-temperature body centered cubic (bcc) phase, which is ferromagentic with a Curie temperature of 1043 K. The structural transition temperature is systematically lowered by alloying elements from the right side of Fe in the periodic table, which effectively lowers the valence electron concentration \\(e/a\\). The transition is displacive and diffusionless between a high-temperature high-symmetry austenitic phase and a low-temperature martensitic phase, in which the symmetry is usually lowered, e. g., by tetragonal distortions. In ferromagnetic Fe-alloys with \\(e/a\\) between 8.7 and 8.5, the martensitic transition disappears and fcc austenite becomes the stable ground state structure. Iron alloys with Ni-group elements at this valence electron concentration are at the center of scientific interest for a long time, as they show, in addition to the martensitic instability, a multitude of magneto-structural anomalies that are of technological importance. The probably most prominent is the so-called Invar effect, describing the over-compensation of thermal expansion in a wide temperature range, which has been intensively studied for more than one century.[1; 2; 3] The best known representative is Fe\\({}_{65}\\)Ni\\({}_{35}\\), but similar behavior is also observed in Fe\\({}_{70}\\)Pd\\({}_{30}\\) and Fe\\({}_{75}\\)Pt\\({}_{25}\\).

The longer-range interactions, on the other hand, are governed by a generalization of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction,[29] depend on the properties of the Fermi surface, and are far more complex in nano-clusters, as a Fermi surface is not yet formed. Also, details of the surroundings of the cluster can play a role due to quantum confinement.[30] Furthermore, the substrate below the surface layer, e.g. buried magnetic clusters or layers,[31] can affect the long-range interactions; even non-magnetic buried structures can play a role as spin-dependent wavefunctions incident from a magnetic atom at the surface can be reflected at the buried structure and propagate to another atom back on the surface, especially in the presence of Fermi-surface focusing.[32] Another type of exchange interaction is the anisotropic exchange of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type, which has been found, for example, to produce a long-wavelength, non-collinear magnetic ground state in Mn overlayers on W(110).[33] This, however, depends on the spin-orbit coupling, and even in transition-metal clusters on Au and Pt (where the spin-orbit coupling is strong), the anisotropic exchange is found to be two orders of magnitude weaker than the nearest-neighbour Heisenberg exchange.[34; 35] In Cu, spin orbit coupling is much weaker, therefore we consider that its effect can be safely neglected for the smallquestion: please summerize this text within 150 words",

In Fe and Co, where the starting point is a ferromagnetic orientation, the opposite will happen: the resonance will narrow down, because majority-majority and minority-minority begins to be blocked; thus, the S-shape is inverted. As the minority spin resonance is bisected by \\(E_{\\rm F}\\) for Fe and Co, the single-particle part of the energy, \\(\\int^{E_{\\rm F}}E\\,n(E)\\,dE\\), will increase, signalling a ferromagnetic coupling of the double-exchange type. Note that the behaviour of \\(j(E)\\) is more spiked at the majority resonance in Mn and Fe, due to the hybridization with the Cu \\(d\\)-states; moreover, in Cr, Mn, and Fe the shape of \\(j(E)\\) around the minority-spin resonance appears to have a double-S form, revealing contributions from different \\(d\\)-orbitals at slightly different energies. Around the S-shapes, the integral \\(J(E)\\) shows peaks (positive or negative, depending on the starting moment configuration) revealing the total strength of the interaction.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

This reveals a net shift of the resonances, apart from the broadening or narrowing, upon rotation of the moments. The net shift stems from the majority-minority-state repulsion, and can be identified with the kinetic exchange. Its maximal value, indicated by arrows in Fig. 2, is strong in Cr, but less so in Mn, probably because the Mn \\(d\\)-states are lower in energy and thus more localized spatially, reducing the hopping. This is one reason why Mn shows a weaker exchange coupling than Cr. Another, more important reason is that for Cr \\(E_{\\rm F}\\) bisects \\(J(E)\\) at a high point, in the middle of the plateau, while for Mn \\(E_{\\rm F}\\) is already at a point strong descent of \\(J(E)\\), close to changing sign.

It is interesting to disclose the strength of the double-exchange by shifting the majority-spin resonances of Fe and Co to lower energies, so that the kinetic exchange is diminished. We achieved this by acting on these states with an attractive potential of 2.7 eV. This resulted in an increase of the coupling by approximately 50% for all Fe and Co clusters. An energy-resolved picture of this can be seen in the case of a Fe dimer, the DOS of which is shown in Fig. 2, labelled \"Fe-de\". Here, \\(J(E)\\) does not show a peak between the resonances any more (the kinetic exchange is now absent), while it is bisected by \\(E_{\\rm F}\\) much closer to its maximum than in the normal Fe dimer.\n\n### Trimers: the role of local geometryquestion: please summerize this text within 150 words",

Considering first the case of double exchange, assume that the majority-spin \\(d\\) levels of the three atoms lie at \\(E_{d}+\\Delta=E_{\\rm F}=0\\).

In the former case, each atom in the cluster has four Cu neighbours, in the latter only three. We see that, on the average, the coupling on Cu(001) is indeed weaker than on Cu(111) (for the same number of transition-metal neighbours). Further evidence comes from examining Fe and Co clusters on Ni(001) and (111) surfaces (not shown here in detail). Here, additional background hybridization is induced on the one hand from the Ni \\(d\\) states at \\(E_{\\rm F}\\) and on the other hand from the smaller lattice parameter. Although the moments, assisted by the ferromagnetic substrate, are slightly larger than on Cu,[8] the exchange coupling within the cluster is significantly weaker, by a factor of up to 50% for Fe/Ni(001) compared to Fe/Cu(001), 40% for Fe/Ni(111) compared to Fe/Cu(111), and 25% for Co/Ni(001) compared to Co/Cu(001).question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

Although the Pt substrate is polarizable, enhancing the moments of Co/Pt compared to Co/Au, the pair exchange coupling is weaker for Co/Pt dimers and trimers, compared to the same formations on Au.[39] This effect could be due to the strong hybridization of the Co \\(d\\) states with the Pt \\(d\\) bands at \\(E_{\\rm F}\\) (the \\(d\\) bands of Au are considerably lower). For larger clusters, however, this trend is not so clear and depends on the local geometry. Additional evidence on the effect of hybridization comes from calculations of Co ad-clusters on Pt(111) in Ref.

        "question": "Finally we comment on the irregular behaviour of Mn clusters. The irregularity arises from the competition of the kinetic and double exchange analyzed in the discussion on the dimers above, and we also saw it in the case of trimers. Small changes in the electronic structure, caused e.g. by local geometry effects or cluster size, can shift the turning point of \\(J(E)\\) up and down in energy, disturbing the delicate balance between kinetic and double exchange. This is the reason that the Mn clusters show a rather irregular behavior in \\(J_{nn^{\\prime}}\\). More to this point, increasing coordination and hybridization will suppress the double-exchange mechanism stronger than the kinetic exchange, as we discussed in Sec. IV. Therefore, the exchange coupling tends to increase with size in Mn clusters, opposite to Cr, Fe, and Co.\n\n### Correlation of exchange and formation energyquestion: please summerize this text within 150 words",

Nevertheless, trends can be observed, and the coupling can be analyzed and understood with respect to simple physical terms, namely ferromagnetic double-exchange, antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange, hybridization of the \\(d\\)-states, and orientation of the \\(d\\)-orbitals. As these mechanisms act in parallel, they interfere and compete, giving at the end a complex and seemingly irregular picture. It becomes then difficult to isolate the mechanisms in experiment for a direct testing of the theory.question: please summerize this text within 150 words",

        "question": "Energy landscapes determine the behaviour and properties of chemical systems (molecules, fluids, solids) - such as the melting temperature, strong/fragile behaviours of liquids, the glass transition, dynamics and kinetics of structural transformations (e.g. displacive, order-disorder and reconstructive phase transitions, protein folding); see [1,2]. However, being a multidimensional function, an energy landscape cannot be directly visualised and even storing all values of this function on the computer would be impractical. The only way forward is to apply some reduction procedure, whereby only the most essential information is extracted and projected onto a small number of physically meaningful discriminators. What kind of information is extracted and how the discriminators are defined depends on a particular purpose, and several approaches have been proposed in the past [e.g. 3-8]. We mention in particular landscape statistics (see, e.g., [3-5]), the disconnectivity graphs [7], orientational bond order parameters [8], and various distance metrics [6,9,10]. Previous works focussed mainly on kinetics and physical properties of clusters, liquids and glasses.
