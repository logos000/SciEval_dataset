        "question": "A plethora of fascinating new phenomena has been recently reported on oxide hetero-structures of transition metal oxides (TMO) and devices.[1; 2; 3] For example, an interface between two insulators behaves as a metal[2] which becomes superconducting at sufficiently low temperatures, while an interface between two antiferromagnets becomes ferromagnetic.[4] These new structures not only create a playground for unexpected physical phenomena to be observed, but, in addition, they open up the possibility for new applications based on radically different foundations. Probing such interesting new phenomena is quite difficult due to impurity effects, lattice imperfections, and other materials-growth limitations. Very recent progress in material synthesis,[1; 3; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9] however, is starting to make it possible to carefully investigate these fascinating systems.Based on the text provided, what is the primary cause that has most recently enabled the careful investigation of new phenomena in oxide hetero-structures of TMO?",

        "question": "The complex, unusual, and as yet not fully discovered or understood behavior of these strongly correlated materials, such as transition metal oxides (TMO), can be manipulated in a variety of fundamentally new applications. In particular, we would like to mention one such possibility which has been recently proposed[10] by one of the authors of the present paper. This is based on the fact that these strongly correlated localized electrons form an electronic system which can be near the metal to Mott-insulator transition.[11] Photovoltaic devices based on carefully chosen doped Mott insulators can produce a significant photovoltaic effect. More importantly, it was found[10] that if the Mott insulator is appropriately chosen, the photovoltaic effect can lead to solar cells of high efficiency, where a single solar photon can produce multiple electron/hole pairs, an effect known as impact ionization, in a time-scale shorter than the time characterizing other relaxation processes. Increase of solar cell efficiency due to this process has been proposed previously for band-gap semiconductors; however, the effect is not significant there, because the characteristic time-scale for impact ionization is comparable to the time-scale for electron-phonon relaxation. The reason that this is not expected to hold for a Mott insulator is that the large Coulomb repulsion present in a Mott insulator leads to a large enhancement of the impact ionization rate.Based on the provided text, what is the underlying cause for the proposed increase in solar cell efficiency when using specially chosen doped Mott insulators as opposed to band-gap semiconductors?",

The valence electron states were expressed as linear combination of plane waves. We found that the plane wave cutoff of 400 eV provided convergent single particle levels. We used the experimental geometry in all the calculations as shown in Fig. 1. We attempted to optimize the structure using the hybrid functional; the converged geometry disagrees with the experimental geometry rather significantly (the largest disagreement of the lattice constants was 3%), giving rise to a larger gap by a factor of 2 than that obtained by the same hybrid functional using the experimental geometry. We applied various numbers of \\(k\\)-points for the unit cell depending on the calculated properties. We found that the required size of the Monkhorst-Pack[33]\\(k\\)-point set depends strongly on the existence of a Mott gap.

Then, we carry out hybrid functional calculations, such as HSE06[30; 31] which involve using a much more computationally demanding computational scheme. The reason we begin from such calculations is that the standard LDA or GGA calculations give a single particle spectrum with significant density of states at the Fermi level (see Fig. 5) and no gap. This is a qualitatively different state from the correct ground state, and, thus, not suitable as a starting place for a perturbative scheme. The hybrid functionals, as we find, give a quasiparticle gap of the same order of magnitude as the observed gap, and thus, we can use them as a starting point in a many-body perturbation theoretical approach to find the leading corrections.Based on the provided text snippet, why are hybrid functional calculations used after standard LDA and GGA-type PBE calculations?",

The direction \\(\\Gamma\\to B\\) and the direction \\(A\\to E\\). The former direction is along the dimerization direction (the a-axis in the M1 phase, see Fig. 1). The latter direction is along the b-axis of the M1 phase (Fig. 1). The former may be due to direct overlap of the \\(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\) orbitals along the a-axis, while the latter may be due to the hybridization of the \\(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\) with the oxygen \\(p_{y}\\). We find that the \\(V1\\) and \\(V2\\) atoms connected to \\(O1\\) have approximately the same distance from \\(O1\\) and the line that begins from \\(O1\\) and bisects the \\(V1-V2\\) line-segment is our \\(y\\)-axis.

By comparing the optical spectra (Fig. 10) to the expanded PDOS in Fig.11, we can see quite clearly the transitions occurring at each peak in the spectra. It seems safe to do so using the projected density of states within the HSE-1/4 picture, as the BSE calculation did not largely shift the position of the peaks in the optical spectra, but only modulated the intensity of the quasiparticle energies. The first peak in the optical spectra is entirely due to the excitation of the filled \\(t_{2g}\\) states to the unfilled anti-bonding \\(t_{2g}\\) states. No other transitions at this energy range are possible. At photon energies of \\(\\sim 3eV\\), the transition from filled \\(O\\)\\(2p\\) states to the same anti-bonding \\(t_{2g}\\) states becomes available. The transition from the filled valence band to the higher-energy \\(V\\)\\(3d(e_{g})\\) anti-bonding states becomes available at about \\(4eV\\), adding to the height of the 2nd peak. The third peak at around \\(8eV\\) arises from the transition between \\(O\\)\\(2p\\) states and the anti-bonding \\(V\\)\\(e_{g}\\) states.In the context of the provided excerpt, which optical transition is responsible for the formation of the first peak in the optical spectra?",

We found that the HSE-1/4, i.e., the HSE06 functional provides a better description to the single particle levels as inferred from quasi-particle correction within GW approximation. However, the calculated gap is about 1.0 eV which is about 0.6 eV larger than gap inferred by room-temperature photoemission measurements. We suspect that the neglected vertex corrections in the quasi-particle correction and/or the electron-phonon interaction are responsible for this discrepancy.\n\nIn agreement with prior work, we find that the transition to the M1 phase causes a Peierls-like distortion which, out of the three bands of \\(t_{2g}\\) symmetry, it affectsBased on the provided text snippet, what is a likely reason for the discrepancy between the calculated gap and the gap inferred by room-temperature photoemission measurements in the VO\\({}_{2}\\) single crystal?",

        "question": "A major new finding in our paper is that the electron-hole interaction in these oxide materials is very strong which leads to significant reduction of the overall response function relative to the starting hybrid functional results. We believe that this may be due to the pronounced localized nature of the \\(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\) orbital and the strong electron correlation arising from the charge localization. Occupied electron states with energy 10 eV below the Fermi-level have _substantial_ effect on the calculated first absorption peak (\\(\\sim\\)0.4 eV). This gives us hope that the screened Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes, which is strong in the M1 phase of VO\\({}_{2}\\), might cause a high impact ionization rate, leading to multi-exciton generation upon high-energy excitation. We believe that this finding could be rather general among TMOs where the same interaction is responsible for the Mott-gap in this class of materials. Thus, Mott-insulators could indeed be an important class of materials of interest for photovoltaic applications. In addition to opto-electronic excitations, doping and extraction of carriers should be addressed in future studies in order to fully explore the applicability of this class of materials in third generation solar cells.The provided text discusses several factors that influence the electronic properties of oxide materials.

Apatiites, with various degrees of substitutions and defects, are commonly found in the Earth's crust and are considered one of the most abundant sources of phosphorous in the marine environment, acting as phosphorous \"sinks\" [1]. Apatiites are also attracting a great interest in the field of biomaterials due to their intrinsic biocompatibility and bioactivity. Calcium phosphates, such as synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAp), fluorapatite (FAp), \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)-tricalcium phosphate (\\(\\alpha\\)-TCP, \\(\\beta\\)-TCP), displayed intrinsic osteoinductive properties, namely the capacity of promoting bone formation without presence of oesteogenic factors, as well as osteeconductive properties (the capacity of supporting and guiding the growth of newly forming bone). Apatiite biocermatics are used in bone repair and augmentation, as bone cements, as coatings for bio-inert prostheses, and for bone scaffolding [2; 3]. The study of natural apatiites is complicated by the fact that the apatite crystal structure can readily accept substitution(s) from a large variety of ions. For example, fluoride ions are found to readily substitute in human enamel, due to their presence in drinking water as a result of soil erosion or added on purpose for caries prevention policies [4]. This capability of accepting various substitutions and incorporating even bulky ions, such as Cd(II) and Cu(II), as well as U(IV), is making this class of materials also attractive for nuclear waste management and water remediation [5; 6].Based on the text, why are apatiites considered significant in the field of biomaterials?",

The published works have been mainly focused on structural and electronic features: a first principles study of fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite has been recently published by Rulis et al. (Ref. [25]) where the authors computed electronic structure, charge distribution and X-ray absorption spectra on a supercell slab along the (001) surface. Some theoretical NMR studies are available in the literature, but they are mainly focused on hydroxyapatite [28; 29; 30]. First principles calculations of NMR parameters have been available for molecules and clusters since the '70s [31; 32; 33; 34; 35] while their application to periodic/crystalline systems was implemented at a later time [36] due to the difficulty of including a macroscopic magnetic field, requiring a non-periodic vector potential. In 2001, Pickard and Mauri implemented the Gauge Including Projector Augmented Wave (GIPAW) method [37] in the plane-wave pseudopotential (PWPP) framework, based on linear-response, aimed at calculations of periodic systems. In the GIPAW method, the key to an accurate evaluation of NMR chemical shifts is the reconstruction of the all-electron wavefunction from a pseudopotential calculation, by a modified PAW transformation, in order to describe the nodal structure of the wavefunction close to the nuclei. Hence the GIPAW method retains the accuracy of all-electron calculations at the much lower cost of pseudopotential calculations, i.e. explicit treatment of valence electrons.Based on the text, why was the application of first principles calculations to periodic/crystalline systems delayed compared to molecules and clusters?",

Experimentally, most of the reference compounds for solid state NMR are molecules dissolved in water or an organic solvent, which are not well suited for calculations with our methodology. Our approach for overcoming this obstacle was therefore to choose solid reference compounds (_secondary reference_), with known experimental chemical shifts with respect to the standard liquid reference compounds (_primary reference_) recommended by IUPAC [46]. In Table 1 the solid reference compounds used in the present study are reported, along with their experimental chemical shifts (\\(\\delta_{iso}^{ref}\\)) and their computed isotropic shielding values (\\(\\sigma_{iso}^{ref}\\)). When more than one value for the experimental chemical shift was available, a range of computed NMR shifts is reported.Based on the excerpt, why is it necessary to choose solid reference compounds (_secondary reference_) when comparing computed data to experimental values in solid state NMR studies?",

This allows the excess carrier energy to be harvested and can fundamentally change solar cell efficiency. Hot carrier transfer was recently demonstrated for optically excited PbSe QDs coupled to a TiO\\({}_{2}\\) substrate [3]. In laser applications, the reverse process is utilized to design the transfer of cold carriers from a quantum well to a QD, reducing the energy deposition by hot carriers and leading to higher gain and lower thresholds [4; 5]. In addition, rapid progress is being made on creating novel memory devices based on QDs. The large tunability of QDs allows flexibility to construct fast volatile memories as well as non-volatile memories with very long retention times, low electrical damage, and the possibility of charge storage based on holes as opposed to electrons [6]. The design strategy of each of these devices must take into account the effects of the local electrostatic environment on tunneling.Based on the provided text snippet, which phenomenon described relies on the transfer of carriers for achieving its key functional improvement?",

Other electrically driven emitters exploit the tunneling of carriers into and out of epitaxial QDs at two different energies to drive the system into electroluminescence [9; 11; 12]. The local electrostatic environment in both types of emitters plays an important role in determining the energy levels and tunneling rates, which in turn control the frequency of emitted light and the efficiency of these devices.

The trend in tunneling rate with carrier mass can thus be substantially altered from the simpler picture found when image effects are neglected. In particular, we identify a regime in which a heavy carrier tunnels at a similar or much higher rate than a light carrier. Interestingly Mazur _et al_ point to several experimental measurements in QD laser systems showing more modest differences between these rates for the two carrier types [4] than is expected from a simple WKB [15] analysis [5]. While the interpretation of these particular experiments requires a proper accounting of surface states and defect states within the barrier, we find that in a parameter regime somewhat different from the conditions in these experiments, the image effects can also yield similar results.Based on the text, how do image effects potentially alter the tunneling rate of carriers in Quantum Dots (QDs)?",

Thus we expect QD emitters to span a large region in the parameter space of our model, and to exhibit a rich interplay between polarization and confinement affecting the binding energy, fluorescence, and electroluminescence in these systems.Based on the provided text, what primary factor influences the interfacial polarization at the QD boundary in optically pumped emitters?",

II, we begin with the Schrodinger equation for a single electron inside the system shown in Fig. 1(a), and derive explicit expressions for its potential energy, and its rate of tunneling between the QD and the electrode. The mathematical details of the derivation are discussed in the Appendix. In Sec. III, we apply this theory to computationally explore the parameter space in the manner described above. In particular, we present the crossover of trends in tunneling rates for various combinations of parameters, and interpret this behavior in terms of the interplay discussed above. Following this section are our conclusions and remarks on the use of our results inside more sophisticated _ab-initio_ calculations of coupled Schrodinger and Poisson equations.\n\n## II Theory\n\n### Electronic statesBased on the text, what is the primary cause of the crossover of trends in tunneling rates for various combinations of parameters?",

Here we generalize these results by accounting for the geometric progression of image charges induced on the electrode and the QD surface. The potential energy is derived based on re-expansion of spherical harmonics [24] around a shifted origin. This approach may be found in several sources, including recent work on plasmonics of nanoparticles supported on a substrate [25]. As appropriate for the optical domain, the solutions presented there apply to an electric field uniform over the particle. Solutions to the Laplace equation within the space bounded by axially symmetric charge distributions in the same geometry have also been given [26]. We present a solution applicable to an arbitrary charge density, as needed for the self energy in the Schrodinger equation.Based on the information provided in the snippet, what is the main reason the potential energy derivation for a charge in a spherical quantum dot has been generalized in the author's approach?",

We obtained this form by adding and subtracting \\(H_{L}\\) to \\(H\\), and then exploiting the relation \\(\\bra{\\psi_{L;k_{z},\\mathbf{k}}}H_{L}\\ket{\\psi_{D}}=E_{L;k_{z},\\mathbf{k}}\\bra{\\psi_{L }}\\psi_{D}\\approx 0\\). The subtraction is advantageous because it naturally restricts the integration domain in (14) to the volume outside the electrode, and thus allows the possibility of computing \\(\\psi_{D}\\) and \\(\\psi_{L}\\) in separate calculations, in which one would focus on the QD and electrode properties respectively. The subtracted Hamiltonian \\(H_{L}\\) is non-vanishing in calculations in which the termination of the potential at the surface occurs smoothly into the junction, as is the case in atomic scale modeling. In the present calculation, \\(H_{L}\\) describes a square well and thus makes no contribution outside the planar surface.', what is the main cause for the advantage of subtraction in Bardeen tunneling theory?",

Within the volume of the QD the slope of the potential, resulting from the image charges on the electrode, reduces as a result of dielectric shielding. The narrow attractive potential straddling outside the QD is due to the image potential at the QD boundary, and it becomes asymmetric with greater depth on the side facing the electrode due to the image charges on the electrode. Below, we will see that the asymmetry partially attracts the charge close to the electrode, and shifts the center of mass of the wavefunctions towards the electrode. Therefore, it could significantly affect tunneling, especially for high \\(\\epsilon\\) which results in a deep potential well. Since, this attractive potential is beyond the atomic scale variations in the potential at the surface of the QD, we must distinguish it from the surface traps formed at the defects. Therefore, in order to keep the terminology clear, we call this the _image potential trap_ (IPT) following Banyai _et al_Banyai et al.

In the right hand panel of Fig. 3, we plot this error, which is the contribution by the electrode's correction to self-consistent multipoles corresponding to the total self energy plotted in the left hand panel. It is clear from the plot that the extra contribution is significant only within the junction, and the correction caused by the image effect to the dipolar and higher order field of the QD is mostly quantitative in \\(\\Sigma\\) and less than 30% in most of the space. The size of this correction increases with the QD size as a larger fraction of the charge on its surface becomes close to the electrode and the potential approaches that of a charge between two parallel plates.

However, the intuitively transparent physical ideas behind the Landau theory as well as the long history of its successful applications have led to a general belief that the GL approach correctly captures, at least qualitatively, essential physics of the superconducting state not only in the vicinity of the critical temperature but in a much wider range of physically plausible situations.Based on the provided text about the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations, what causative relationship does the text emphasize between various superconducting theories?",

[4]).

One of them is the problem of selecting all relevant contributions of the same order of magnitude, which is not trivial for the terms that contain spatial derivatives of the order parameter(s). Another problem is related to increased nonlinearity and to the appearance of higher-order spatial derivatives in the resulting equations.

        "question": "It has recently been demonstrated [6; 24] that these problems can be overcome if one directly employs the proximity of the system to the critical temperature, i.e., using \\(\\tau=1-T/T_{c}\\) as a single small parameter in the system rather than the order parameter and its spatial derivatives. As is well known from the GL theory, \\(\\tau\\) controls all the relevant quantities and their spatial gradients. Within this approach, the GL theory and its extension follow from the systematic \\(\\tau\\)-expansion of the free energy and the gap equation. An important advantage of using the \\(\\tau\\)-expansion is that the extension to the GL theory is specified by linear differential equations that do not have unphysical solutions and can be easily solved numerically and, in many cases, even analytically. For the two-band system this approach has been briefly outlined in Ref. [6] where the main steps of the derivation were presented and the prime physical conclusions were discussed, namely, that the difference between the spatial profiles of the band condensates is captured in the leading correction to the ordinary GL theory. For the sake of clarity the analysis in that work has been restricted to the case of zero magnetic field. Validity and accuracy of the obtained equations have not been discussed. Subsequently, in Ref. [24] we have provided details of the derivation of the extended GL theory for a single-band clean superconductor with the \\(s\\)-wave pairing in the general case of a non-zero magnetic field.Based on the provided text, why is the \\\\(\\\\tau\\\\) parameter employed in the system instead of the order parameter and its spatial derivatives?",

        "question": "The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II a general expression for the free-energy functional of a clean two-band superconductor with \\(s\\)-wave pairing as well as the corresponding matrix gap equation are recollected. Section III introduces the \\(\\tau\\)-expansion following the main steps discussed in Ref. [24]. In Sec. IV we obtain the three leading terms of the expansion of the free-energy functional. In Sec. V the corresponding \\(\\tau\\)-expansion for the matrix gap equation is derived, which yields consequently the equation for \\(T_{c}\\), the ordinary GL theory and the leading correction to the ordinary GL formalism (altogether it is referred to as the extended GL theory). The validity of the \\(\\tau\\)-expansion is also discussed here. In Sec. VI we consider the interplay of the two contributing condensates that reveals itself in the leading correction to the ordinary GL formalism. We calculate the next-to-leading contribution to the thermodynamic critical magnetic field and show that it differs significantly from the single-band case. Here we also investigate the difference in the length-scales of the band condensates as dependent on the basic microscopic parameters. A high accuracy of the extended GL formalism is demonstrated in Sec. VII by comparing its results to the solution of the full BCS model in the spatially homogeneous case. The results of the existing two-component GL-like models [4; 25] are also displayed here. Summary and conclusions are given in Sec. VIII.In the study presented in the paper, what primary consequence does the \\\tau\\-expansion have on the matrix gap equation for a clean two-band superconductor?",

[24], where the existence of a single scaling parameter is obvious from the GL theory, the use of such a single small parameter in the presence of two(many) bands requires an additional justification. For example, if one considers non-interacting band condensates with different critical temperatures, no unique small parameter can be found. The reason why the single-parameter-scaling procedure is applicable for the interacting condensates, follows from the earlier analysis where the matrix gap equation was decoupled into two separate equations for each condensate. [5; 6] It has been demonstrated that for non-zero interband coupling, the separated equations are governed by the same parameter \\(\\tau\\) measuring the deviation from the single critical temperature. In this paper we directly employ this fact without following the same procedure of the explicit separation into two equations for the band components. The consistency of the formalism is ensured by the fact that the series expansion, obtained as a result of this procedure, is unique and coincides with that previously obtained by decoupling the matrix gap equation.

        "question": "The validity of the formalism developed above relies on the relevance of the overall expansion in \\(\\tau\\) as well as on the accuracy of the approximation when only the two lowest orders are retained. The relevance of any expansion is limited by the convergence of the resulting series, which is defined by the presence of the critical points and singularities in the function they describe. In our case this function is the solution to the BCS gap equation that has two critical points. The first one is the transition temperature \\(T_{c}\\), which is the starting point of our expansion and so does not influence the convergence of our series in \\(\\tau\\). The second critical point appears due to the presence of two bands. One can see that in the limiting case of the vanishing interband coupling, each of the two decoupled condensates has its own critical temperature. This is reflected in the fact that Eq. (24) has two solutions: \\(T_{c}\\) and \\(T^{*}<T_{c}\\). The second critical point is approached at \\(T=T^{*}\\) in the limit \\(g_{12}\\to 0\\): here \\(T^{*}\\) becomes the critical temperature of a weaker band taken as an independent superconducting system. This is why at sufficiently small interband couplings one observes pronounced changes in the properties of the weaker band close to \\(T^{*}\\), which prompted the name \"hidden criticality\".[30] Even though formally the \\(\\tau\\)-expansion will not break at \\(T^{*}\\) for \\(g_{12}\\neq 0\\), one can hardly expect that keeping only the two lowest-order terms in the expansion will be sufficient to capture both the critical behavior near \\(T_{c}\\) and the hidden criticality around \\(T^{*}\\) (see the discussion of our numerical results below in Sec. VII). However, when the interband coupling increases, effects due to the presence of the second critical point are smoothed and eventually washed out. Results of Ref. [30] make it possible to find [based on Eq. (4) in this reference] that the impact of the hidden criticality is controlled by the parameter \\((\\tau^{*}/\\delta)^{1/3}\\), where \\(\\tau^{*}=1-T^{*}/T_{c}\\) and \\(\\delta=\\lambda_{12}/(\\lambda_{11}\\lambda_{22})\\), with the dimensionless coupling constants \\(\\lambda_{ij}=g_{ij}N(0)\\) and \\(N(0)=\\sum_{j}N_{j}(0)\\) the total DOS. It is, therefore, expected that at moderate or strong interband couplings the accuracy of the formalism will be sufficient also in the vicinity of \\(T^{*}\\) and, possibly, even at lower temperatures.Based on the provided text, what is the primary reason for the reduced accuracy of the \\\\(\tau\\\\)-expansion approximation when only the two lowest orders are retained?",

        "question": "The most interesting aspect of multiband superconductivity is how the interplay between the condensate components manifests itself in the properties of the system. It has been demonstrated in the previous section that accounting for terms of the same accuracy to the two lowest orders in \\(\\tau\\) leads to the effectively-single-band GL theory with the two band order parameters simply proportional to one another. However, in the leading correction to this theory, the structure of the relevant equations dictates that the spatial distributions of different condensates become different, leading to a competition of the different length-scales which is absent in single-band superconductors. Furthermore, microscopic parameters of the bands enter both the effectively-single-band GL theory and the leading correction to it as follows from Eqs. (33) and (37). Therefore, both bands always contribute to all pertinent characteristics of the system. This may also lead to considerable deviations of the system properties as compared to the single-band case. Below we provide two examples, where the interplay of the band condensates is essential, i.e., (i) we consider the next-to-leading contribution in \\(\\tau\\) to the thermodynamic critical magnetic field and (ii) investigate how the difference in the spatial profiles of the two band condensates depends on the basic microscopic parameters.Based on the provided excerpt, what is one major consequence of the interplay between the condensate components in multiband superconductivity?",

This is demonstrated in Fig. 1, where the ratio \\(H_{c}^{(1)}/H_{c}^{(0)}\\) is plotted as a function of \\(\\chi\\). In the calculations we use three sets of the dimensionless coupling constants: (a) \\(\\lambda_{11}=1.88\\), \\(\\lambda_{22}=0.5\\) and \\(\\lambda_{12}=0.21\\) extracted from the data for MgB\\({}_{2}\\) (see Ref.

        "question": "It has been demonstrated in Sec. V that the ordinary GL theory, defined by Eqs. (25), (32) and (34), leads to the same spatial profile for the two band condensates, although the parameters of the effectively-single-component GL equation (32) do depend on both bands. However, invoking the extended GL formalism, one can easily see from Eqs. (30), (36), (43), and (47) that differences in the spatial characteristics of the band condensates appear already in the leading correction to the ordinary GL theory. As follows from Eq. (30), there are two terms in \\(\\vec{\\Delta}^{(1)}\\). The first term is proportional to \\(\\vec{\\eta}_{+}\\) and has the same structure as Eq. (25). Its presence does not induce any difference in the spatial profiles of the condensates. However, the second term is proportional to the second basis vector \\(\\vec{\\eta}_{-}\\) that has a component orthogonal to \\(\\vec{\\eta}_{+}\\). Therefore, when \\(\\varphi_{-}\\neq 0\\), one immediately finds that \\(\\Delta_{1}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\) is not proportional to \\(\\Delta_{2}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\). Thus, the band order parameters \\(\\Delta_{1}({\\bf r})\\) and \\(\\Delta_{2}({\\bf r})\\) are generally specified by different spatial profiles, and this difference disappears only in the limit \\(T\\to T_{c}\\), which reproduces the result of our previous short study.[6] Notice that the present derivation follows just from the general structure of the \\(\\tau\\)-expansion for the matrix gap equation and so it is significantly simpler than the comparative analysis of the separate equations for \\(\\Delta_{1}^{(1)}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{2}^{(2)}\\) performed in Ref.

V.2, the expansion always mix \\(\\vec{\\Delta}^{(n)}\\) with \\(\\vec{\\Delta}^{(n+1)}\\) [see, e.g., Eq.

Therefore, notwithstanding the concrete truncation of \\(R_{\\nu}\\), \\(\\vec{\\Delta}^{(n+1)}\\) is a nonzero functional of \\(\\vec{\\Delta}^{(0)},\\ldots\\vec{\\Delta}^{(n)}\\). As a result, \\(\\Delta_{\\nu}\\) is always given by an infinite series in powers of \\(\\tau\\).

This derivation follows the ideas briefly outlined in our earlier letter [6] and generalizes our recent analysis of the single-band system. [24] The formalism is based on a systematic expansion of the free-energy functional and the matrix gap equation in powers of the deviation from the critical temperature \\(\\tau=1-T/T_{c}\\). We have calculated the three lowest orders of this expansion that yield the equation for \\(T_{c}\\), the ordinary GL theory and the leading correction to it, which all together are referred to as the extended GL formalism. Similar to the single-band case, the next-to-leading in \\(\\tau\\) contributions to the band order parameters have been found to satisfy inhomogeneous linear differential equations with a relatively simple structure. They can be easily solved numerically and, in many cases, even analytically. The extended GL formalism constructed via the \\(\\tau\\)-expansion does not suffer from unphysical solutions which often hinders the applicability of other extended GL theories.In the context of the extended GL formalism for a clean $s$-wave two-band superconductor described in the provided text, what is the primary reason for conducting a systematic expansion of the free-energy functional and the matrix gap equation in powers of the deviation from the critical temperature $\tau=1-T/T_{c}$?",

Straightforward analytical results of the present work reiterate our earlier conclusion [6] that, apart from some very special cases, the band condensates in a two(multi)-band superconductor have generally different spatial length-scales. In addition, the simple structure of the formalism makes it possible to point out a strong relevance of the interplay between the two band condensates that can lead to significant deviations of the properties of the superconductor from the single-band case. In particular, contrary to single-band superconductors, the next-to-leading in \\(\\tau\\) contribution to the thermodynamic critical magnetic field can be of different sign depending on the material parameters in the two-band case, thereby changing the temperature dependence of the critical field from concave to convex.Based on the provided text, which of the following explanations best describes why the \t-tau-expansion procedure is considered advantageous for analyzing multiband superconductors?",

From the practical side, as was recently demonstrated, the metallic substrate can be used for the preparation of graphene layers of different thicknesses with the extraordinary quality that can be transferred onto an insulating or polymer support [4; 5; 6; 7]. In the latter case the obtained material was successfully used for the fabrication of flexible touch screens [7]. These facts together with the relative easiness of the preparation procedure of graphene on metals and its transfer onto the polymer or insulating support make this method a most promising one for the graphene industry. Additionally, in any of the technical applications the metallic contacts to a graphene layer determine the doping of graphene (and, as a consequence, its transport properties) that points the importance of studies of the graphene/metal interface [8; 9; 10].What has driven the intense focus on the physics and chemistry of graphene overlayers on metallic surfaces since 2004?",

For example, the weakening of the bonding between graphene and \\(d\\)-metals from the 4th and 5th periods of the periodic table can be related to the filling of the corresponding \\(d\\) shell. This leads to a decrease of the degree of hybridization between \\(d\\) states of the metal and the \\(\\pi\\) states of graphene (effect of hybridization has to fulfill two conditions simultaneously: spatial and energetic overlapping of orbitals). The representative example here is the difference of the graphene behavior on the Ni(111) and Cu(111) surfaces. Both interfaces are lattice-matched. The graphene/Ni(111) interface is the representative example of the so-called \"strong\" interaction between graphene and the metallic substrate with the significant hybridization of the graphene \\(\\pi\\) and Ni \\(3d\\) states that leads to the complete destruction of the graphene Dirac cone [9; 10; 11; 12]. In the case of \"weakly\" bonded graphene/Cu(111) the theoretical description of this system [the small lattice-mismatch of 3.9% between graphene and Cu(111) is omitted] shows that the graphene-derived Dirac cone is preserved in the electronic structure [9] and its position is defined by the doping level. These observations are explained by the absence of hybridization around the Fermi level (\\(E_{F}\\)) between Cu \\(3d\\) and graphene \\(\\pi\\) states. A similar approach can be used for the description of bonding mechanisms of graphene on surfaces of \\(4d\\) and \\(5d\\) transition metals.Based on the provided text, what causes the preservation of the graphene-derived Dirac cone in the graphene/Cu(111) interface?",

It is interesting to note that in all graphene-metal systems the bonding energy of graphene is too small compared to the value which can be estimated from the temperatureConsidering the provided information, what is the primary reason for the decreased strength of interaction of graphene with metal surfaces in sequences such as Co-Rh-Ir and Ni-Pd-Pt?",

        "question": "Another interesting question related to the graphene-metal interface is the existense or absence of the energy gap in the energy dispersion for the graphene \\(\\pi\\) states around the Dirac point. Generally, the appearance of such an energy gap is connected with the breaking of the sublattice symmetry in the graphene layer. However the carbon atoms of the graphene unit cell occupy nonequivalent positions in all cases of the graphene adsorption on a metallic substrate. Thus, one should expect violation of the sublattice symmetry and, as a consequence, the appearance of an energy gap in the electronic spectrum of graphene. In fact, the situation is not so unequivocal. Whereas, for the \"strongly\" bonded graphene on metals the appearance of such a gap is more or less obvious (due to the strong hybridization between valence band electronic states of graphene and metal and high level of doping) and was observed experimentally (and confirmed theoretically) for graphene on Ni(111), Co(0001), or Ru(0001) [20; 21; 22], for the \"weakly\" bonded graphene the experimental data are inconsistent. For example, some experimental results for graphene on Au(111) or Cu(111) indicates the existence of such a gap [23; 24], whereas for the graphene/Al(111) system experimental data demonstrate no gap [9; 26]. The theoretical calculations predict the gap-less situation in all cases of the \"weakly\" bonded graphene on metals [9; 26].Based on the provided text, what is the primary cause of the appearance of an energy gap in the electronic spectrum of graphene when adsorbed on a metallic substrate?",

According to recent theoretical studies, SiC nanosheets as well as armchair SiCNRs (A-SiCNRs) behave as nonmagnetic wide band gap semiconductors, [9; 10; 11] whereas zigzag SiCNRs (Z-SiCNRs) are magnetic (with very small magnetic moments) [11; 12] and can present metallic or semiconducting character, depending on the width of the nanoribbon [11; 12; 13] (half-metallicity was predicted for Z-SiCNRs narrower than 4 nm, [11] which makes these NRs promising candidates for spintronic applications). However, _ab initio_ investigations have recently shown that these characteristics can be modified by the presence of some impurities and defects. For example, it has been observed that (i) substitutional B, N, As, and P impurities induce magnetism in SiC sheets, [10] (ii) half-metallic Z-SiCNRs become metallic when doped with N atoms, [14] and (iii) B (N) substituting an edge Si (C) atom transforms semiconducting Z-SiCNRs into half-metallic systems.

We used an energy cutoff of 200 Ry for the real-space mesh and a double-zeta basis set with polarization functions for all atoms. We considered Z-SiCNR with width W = 6 (6Z-SiCNR), as depicted in Fig. 1.

Additional test calculations were also carried out for large supercells (12Z-SiCNR) containing 156 atoms to see the convergence of our numerical results. All atomic positions were fully relaxed until the forces on each atom were smaller than 0.05 eV/A.

The electronic band structure [Fig. 2(a)] and the density of states [Fig. 3(a)] show that 6Z-SiCNR exhibits half-metallic behavior: the spin-up channel is semiconducting (with a direct band gap of about 0.41 eV at the \\(\\Gamma\\) point) whereas the spin-down channel is metallic. As can be seen in Fig. 3(a), the partially occupied spin-down electronic state is mainly composed of \\(p\\) orbitals of the edge C and Si atoms. The 6Z-SiCNR also has a very small magnetic moment, about 0.03\\(\\mu_{B}\\) per supercell. Our results are in agreement with a previous theoretical work [11] which reports magnetic moment of \\(0.023\\mu_{B}\\) per cell in 6Z-SiCNR, and predicts half-metallicity in Z-SiCNRs narrower than 4 nm. The spin-density distribution of pristine 6Z-SiCNR [Fig. 4(a)] shows that the magnetic moments are mainly localized on the edge atoms, and their orientations are parallel at each edge and antiparallel between the two edge atoms. Each edge C (Si) atom has a local magnetic moment of about \\(0.16\\mu_{B}\\) (\\(-0.17\\mu_{B}\\)), while the total magnetic moment of the other C (Si) atoms is about \\(0.29\\mu_{B}\\) (\\(-0.20\\mu_{B}\\)).

[10] On the other hand, \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) appears to play different roles in the magnetism of Z-SiCNRs, A-SiCNRs and SiC sheets: while we found a magnetic moment of 1.19\\(\\mu_{B}\\) induced by a single \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) in 6Z-SiCNRs, recent theoretical works have reported that the presence of a single \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) does not give rise to any magnetic moment in SiC sheets [10; 16] and A-SiCNRs. [10] This suggests that 6Z-SiCNR, where magnetism can be tuned either by Si or C vacancies, can be a promising candidate for spintronics. In the following paragraphs we will discuss the origin of the magnetism in the V\\({}_{\\rm C}\\)/6Z-SiCNR system, showing that it is almost entirely due to the magnetization of the edge C atoms. As we have shown that V\\({}_{\\rm C}\\)/6Z-SiCNR system is magnetic. To be more confident about the magnetism of V\\({}_{\\rm C}\\)/6Z-SiCNR, we also carried out calculations using a large supercell (156 atoms) and created a carbon vacancy and relaxed all the atoms. Interestingly, we found that this system also leads to magnetism in SiCNR and the magnetism was mainly originated from the edge C atoms. Therefore, we confirm that the magnetism of V\\({}_{\\rm C}\\)/6Z-SiCNR is not due to structural relaxation, but due to the C edge atoms.Based on the excerpt, what is the primary cause of magnetism in the V\textsubscript{C}/6Z-SiCNR system?",

However, we observed a quite different nature of magnetism, e.g., atoms surrounding \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\) (\\(V_{\\rm C}\\)) have large (small) local positive (negative) magnetic moments.

In contrast, we found that a single \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) transforms the half-metallic 6Z-SiCNR into a metallic system [see Figs. 2(c) and 3(c)]. Note that the half-metallicity is mainly destroyed by the \\(p\\) orbitals of the edge atoms and the atoms surrounding the vacancy. Figure 3(c) shows that the partially occupied spin-up electronic state consists mainly of \\(p\\) orbitals of the edge Si atoms and of the Si atoms surrounding the vacancy, with no contribution from \\(p\\) orbitals of the edge C atoms. This shows that the electronic structure can easily be tuned either by creating holes (simply based on electron counting), i.e., \\(V_{\\rm C}\\), or by electron doping, i.e., N-doping.[14] We attribute this electronic phase transition to hole doping.[29] The electronic phase transition is mainly due to Si-\\(p\\) orbitals which are delocalized as compared with the C-\\(p\\) orbitals. The total densities of states in Fig. 3(a-c) show that the population of density of states (within an energy range of \\(\\pm 0.5\\) eV) in spin-up states of electrons increases as we move from pristine to \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) system.

        "question": "The formation energies and the total magnetic moments per supercell for \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{i}\\) and \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{i}\\) in 6Z-SiCNR are presented in Table 1 (the defect formation energies were calculated using Eq. (2)). These results show that the presence of double Si vacancies can give rise to large magnetic moments in Z-SiCNRs (for example, we found magnetic moments of about 3.9\\(\\mu_{B}\\) in \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{3}/6\\)Z-SiCNR and \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{4}/6\\)Z-SiCNR). However, the formation of these magnetic \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{i}/6\\)Z-SiCNR systems is quite unlikely, since they have very high formation energies [see Table 1]. It is also noticeable the \\(V_{\\rm Si}-V_{\\rm Si}\\) interactions reduce the magnetic moments as compared with the single \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\) system. The formation of \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{i}\\), which also induce magnetic moments in 6Z-SiCNRs, is energetically favorable when compared with a single \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\) and double \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{i}\\). For instance, \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{8}\\), \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{12}\\), and \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{13}\\) have formation energies smaller than 4.7 eV, and induce magnetic moments of 1.34, -0.93 and -0.57\\(\\mu_{B}\\) in 6Z-SiCNR, respectively [see Table 1]. It is worth mentioning here that recent experimental works have shown that defects created in 6H-SiC bulk by neutron or ion irradiations are mainly formed by \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\) divacancies and induce room-temperature magnetism in diamagnetic SiC crystals.[17; 18] Such experimental results illustrate that \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\) are the stable intrinsic defects in 6H-SiC, and we also found that \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\) types defects are easy to be formed in NR as compared with \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\). Table 1 clearly shows that \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\) divacancies have oscillatory type magnetism where the magnetic moments oscillate and strongly depend on the location of the C vacancy. This rise and fall of magnetic moments in \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\) divacancies system is similar to bulk SiC crystal.[18] Comparing the defects, we note that this rise and fall of magnetic moments is suppressed by filling the C vacant site with N, which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.Based on the provided text, what is the primary reason for the energetic favorability of the formation of \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{i}\\) divacancies in 6Z-SiCNRs compared to double \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{i}\\) vacancies?",

        "question": "Figure 5 and 6 present the electronic band structures [Fig. 5] and the spin-density distributions [Fig. 6] for some representative magnetic systems with two vacancies per supercell, viz., \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{4}/6\\)Z-SiCNR and \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{8}/6\\)Z-SiCNR. As can be seen in Fig. 5, both \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{4}/6\\)Z-SiCNR and \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{8}/6\\)Z-SiCNR systems exhibit semiconducting character, with band gaps of 0.91 eV (0.15 eV) and 0.31 eV (0.04 eV) for the spin-up (-down) channels of \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{4}/6\\)Z-SiCNR and \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{8}/6\\)Z-SiCNR, respectively. These results indicate that the presence of double vacancies (\\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm Si}\\) or \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\)) can transform half-metallic Z-SiCNRs into semiconducting systems. As we increased the vacancy concentrations to \\(\\sim 5.56\\%\\) (in double vacancy systems), half-metal to semiconductor phase transition is observed. This phase transition is due to holes which are localized on the dangling bonds around the vacancies but also have some contribution from the edge atoms. Usually, when a vacancy is created some states around the Fermi level, which are occupied in the pristine system, are removed and such removal of states creates holes around the Fermi energy which changes the electronic structure of the material.[32; 33; 34; 28] In Fig. 2(a) we see some states just below the Fermi level; however, when a Si vacancy is created, some missing states (near to \\(X\\)-point) can be seen [see Fig. 2(b)]. Similar holes were also observed in SiC monolayer with a Si vacancy.[16] In 6Z-SiCNR, the electronic and magnetic structures are not only modified by the atoms surrounding a vacancy but also by the edge atoms[12] (also see Fig. 4(d)). This makes 6Z-SiCNR different from other materials where magnetism is caused by vacancies. Our results teach us that the electronic band structure of Z-SiCNRs can easily be engineered by \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\) or \\(V_{\\rm C}\\). The distribution of spin density in \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{4}/6\\)Z-SiCNR [Fig. 6(a)] shows that the magnetic moments are mostly localized on the C atoms surrounding the Si vacancies. The C atoms around \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{4}\\) have magnetic moments of 0.23, 0.88 and 0.88\\(\\mu_{B}\\), while the C atoms around \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}\\) have magnetic moments of 1.06, 0.91 and 0.91\\(\\mu_{B}\\). On the other hand, in \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{8}/6\\)Z-SiCNR [Fig. 6(b)] we observe that the C atoms surrounding \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}\\) move to form new C-C bonds; thus, the dangling bonds of these atoms are recombined leading to almost zero local magnetic moments. In this system the magnetic moments are mostly localized on edge C atoms: we found magnetic moments between 0.16 and 0.21\\(\\mu_{B}\\) for each edge C atom.Based on the provided text excerpt, what is the primary cause of the transformation of half-metallic Z-SiCNRs into semiconducting systems?",

As can be seen, the semiconducting character of \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{4}\\)/6Z-SiCNR is maintained when B is doped at the vacant Si\\({}^{4}\\) site: both the spin-up and spin-down channels of \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}B_{\\rm Si}^{4}\\)/6Z-SiCNR [Fig. 7(a)] are semiconducting with band gaps of 0.19 and 0.13 eV, respectively. However, the presence of a N atom occupying a vacant C site can lead semiconducting \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\)/6Z-SiCNR systems to turn into half-metallic ones. Fig. 7(b) shows that the \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}N_{\\rm C}^{8}\\)/6Z-SiCNR system is a half-metal: while its spin-down channel is metallic, the spin-up channel is semiconducting with band gap of 0.52 eV. It is interesting to note that \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}B_{\\rm Si}^{4}\\)/6Z-SiCNR remains semiconducting consisting with our picture of hole-induced electronic phase transition. When a vacant \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{i}\\) site is filled with boron in bivacancy \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm Si}^{i}\\) system, it means that we are filling the empty orbitals (holes) created by \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{i}\\). However, the \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}B_{\\rm Si}^{4}\\) system has sufficient holes, compared with the pristine 6Z-SiCNRs, and remains semiconducting as expected. Boron mainly induces impurity states near the Fermi level in both spin-up and spin-down channels [see Fig. 7(a)]. On the other hand when N is doped at \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) site in \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{i}\\) system, electrons are injected into \\(V_{\\rm Si}^{1}V_{\\rm C}^{i}\\) and we have sufficient electrons to fill the empty states.

Such re-entrant behavior of 6Z-SiCNR is ascribed to electron doping.Based on the excerpt, what is the primary cause of the transformation of the semiconducting character in the V_Si V_C/6Z-SiCNR system when N is introduced at a vacant C site?",

        "question": "_Ab-initio_ calculations were performed to investigate the magnetism of pristine and defected Z-SiCNRs. Single (\\(V_{\\rm Si}\\) and \\(V_{\\rm C}\\)) and double (\\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm Si}\\) and \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\)) vacancies were considered to probe the electronic structures of Z-SiCNRs. Our results indicate that these native defects can induce large magnetic moments in Z-SiCNRs. While the half-metallic character of the pristine Z-SiCNR is maintained in the presence of a single \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\), we found that a single \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) leads to a transition from half-metallic to metallic behavior in Z-SiCNRs, and double \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm Si}\\) and \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\) can transform half-metallic Z-SiCNRs into semiconducting systems. Such electronic phase transitions were discussed in terms of hole doping. Single \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\) induced the largest magnetic moment among the defects investigated, but this defect has higher formation energy and is energetically unfavorable when compared with the single \\(V_{\\rm C}\\) and double \\(V_{\\rm Si}V_{\\rm C}\\). The ferromagnetic ground state was shown to be more stable than the antiferromagnetic state; therefore, room-temperature ferromagnetism was also speculated in defected Z-SiCNRs. To reduce the defect formation energy of single \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\) and realize it experimentally, the interactions of substitutional B and N impurities with this native defect were also studied. We found that a B atom substituting a Si atom, as well as a N atom substituting a C atom in the presence of vacancies, leads to a considerable reduction of the defect formation energy of \\(V_{\\rm Si}\\). Therefore, we believe that light elements are beneficial for the realization of room-temperature magnetism in defective Z-SiCNRs.Based on the given text, which scenario is most directly responsible for transforming a half-metallic Z-SiCNR into a metallic Z-SiCNR?",

        "question": "_: Amorphous carbon \\((a-C)\\) thin films have long been considered as very important materials for understanding the fundamentals of electronic structure [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6] and mechanical properties [7; 8; 9]. Depending on the preparation method, a very diverse nature of microstructure can be formed ranging from diamond-like to graphite-like carbon. Significant efforts have been made to explain the optical properties of \\(a-C\\) films based on the estimated band gap and degree of disorder [10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18]. There are also numerous interesting results showing a structure-dependent conductivity crossover in \\(a-C\\) films [19; 20; 21; 22]. However, a rigorous theoretical model of electrical transport of \\(a-C\\) films related to the carbon microstructure is yet to be developed that can explain the experimentally observed highly non-linear variation of the conductivity with \\(sp^{2}\\) bond concentration [12; 18]. In carbon the electronic properties can be strongly influenced by bond disorder which depends on the \\(sp^{2}/sp^{3}\\) bond aspect ratio and on the \\(sp^{2}\\) cluster size. Although there is no well defined structure for \\(a-C\\) films they have been described in many studies as a mixture of \\(sp^{2}\\) and \\(sp^{3}\\) hybridized bonds [10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18]. A number of spectroscopic techniques, for example Raman, optical absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy, have confirmed this assertion [2; 8; 14; 15]. It was found that the size of the \\(sp^{2}-C\\) clusters greatly influenced the band-gap [2]. The optical absorption edge was described by a Gaussian plot based on the normal distribution of cluster size [23]. Films with low \\(sp^{2}\\) concentrations have also been described as quasi-\\(1D\\) polymer chains (e.g. transpolyacetylene) [3; 15; 16; 17; 23; 24]. The effect of \\(1D\\) filamentary channels on electronic transport has been observed in low-dimensional \\(a-C\\) films and related devices [25]. However, no significant theoretical studies have yet been undertaken to investigate the tunneling properties unlike in \\(1D\\) molecular structures [26]. Based on previous studies we believe that \\(a-C\\) films can be described effectively as a distribution of periodical alternation of the hopping energy and constant energy term. Starting from previous experimental claims for the variation of disorder with the energy gap [12; 14; 15], we establish the trend of localization length in a wide range of carbon films based on the calculated transmission coefficients \\(T(E)\\) and local density of states (LDOS). In this Letter we propose a Gaussian disorder analogous to previous studies [12; 14; 15] but in a different manner which is directly connected to the microstructure of \\(a-C\\) films. Since the nature of topological disorder has not been clearly understood from previous works we briefly discuss this effect on electron transmission at the end of this Letter.Based on the provided text about amorphous carbon (a-C) films, what is the main factor influencing the highly non-linear variation of conductivity with sp² bond concentration?",

In this Letter a typical hopping disorder parameter \\(\\delta\\) for a Gaussian distribution of the hopping term \\(t_{\\pi}\\) is shown in Fig. 2(b) for 3 cases, A, B and C as a function of \\(E_{\\pi}\\), which covers the major possible behaviors of disorder in carbon structures. Models B and C are suggestions for the behavior of the disorder parameter based on the assumption that the disorder parameter can either increase or decrease with the \\(E_{\\pi}\\) corresponding to either \\(sp^{3}\\) rich or \\(sp^{2}\\) rich structures. The values of the disorder parameter for model A \\(\\delta\\) can be extracted from a number of experiments (e.g., Raman \\(G\\)-peak linewidth) [12; 14; 15] and we believe it is the result of two competing processes (B and C). On this basis, we have determined the behavior of the disorder parameter as a function of \\(E_{\\pi}\\). We therefore focus on model A as it corresponds to the physical nature of \\(a-C\\) systems. A number of \\(sp^{2}-C\\) percentages were chosen to cover a wide range. The corresponding \\(E_{\\pi}\\) values (and hence corresponding values for \\(\\delta\\)) were determined based on the relationship between \\(sp^{2}-C\\) % and \\(E_{\\pi}\\). We found that the values of \\(E_{\\pi}\\) were very close to the values of \\(E_{res}\\). Here \\(2E_{\\pi}\\) is the peak-to-peak energy spacing of bonding and antibonding DOS above and below the \\(E_{f}\\)[15]. For case A, the disorder reaches its maximum at about \\(E_{\\pi}=1.9\\ eV\\), followed by a slight decrease. This is an attribute of the structural relaxation, which occurs (also for case B) when \\(sp^{2}\\) clusters become relatively large [2; 3]. For case C the disorder increases sharply with \\(E_{\\pi}\\) corresponding to the rise of \\(sp^{3}\\) phase content.

With the decrease of \\(sp^{2}\\) bond concentration and increase of disorder in model A, we observe an increase in the \\(2E_{res}\\) value (the effective band gap), broadening of the peak width and a decrease in peak-to-valley ratio. With further decrease of \\(sp^{2}\\) bond concentration, the resonance peaks move closer to the \\(sp^{3}\\) band gap and finally disappear. Models A and C show significant broadening of the resonant peaks compared to case B for low \\(sp^{2}\\) % since disorder is large (see Fig. 3(c) and (d), insets) although it is very similar for all cases for high \\(sp^{2}\\) %. At large \\(sp^{2}\\) percentages the transmission through the structure is high therefore structural effects only slightly influence the transmission coefficient. When the \\(sp^{2}\\) percentage is low, the transmission is also low hence even slight structural changes have a large effect on \\(T(E)\\).Based on the observations in Fig. 3, what is the primary cause of reduced transmission coefficient at low sp² bond concentrations?",

At small energies \\(L_{loc}\\) is longer for case A and C than for case B because the structure is more transparent at resonant energies for lower disorder (Fig.4(a), lower curves). The localization length decreases sharply for all 3 cases till \\(E_{res}\\) reaches the value of about 1 \\(eV\\) with a further saturation showing an exponential behavior. The resistance behaves oppositely to the localization length (Fig.4(a), upper curves). At small energies the resistance is smallest for case C and largest for case B following the distortion parameter dependence. The structural resistance increases till \\(E_{res}=2\\ eV\\) followed by a slight decrease at higher energies in the natural logarithm scale. This value is related to the mobility edge- as the disorder parameter increases, the transmission maxima shift away from \\(E_{f}\\) towards the mobility edge. The lifetime of resonant states therefore decreases (the full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreases). At large energies it is greater for case A and C (almost coincide) because of the larger distortion values.

The resonant peaks can therefore be tuned by disorder of both types which can be controlled to some extent experimentally through annealing or irradiation of the films [30]. Based on the bond length distribution included in the model, different ring structures e.g. five fold and seven fold symmetry, additional so-called topological disorder can be included subject to further study.The following excerpt discusses the interplay between energy splitting, structural disorder, and bond length variation in a material system: 'The characteristic energy splitting, \\\\(\\delta\\varepsilon_{top}\\\\), is proportional to \\\\(\frac{\\delta u}{w^{3}}\\\\), where \\\\(w\\\\) and \\\\(\\delta w\\\\) are the average cluster size and its characteristic variation.

        "question": "_Conclusion_: In this Letter, the importance of the nonlinear disorder vs. energy model (case A), an intermediate to uniform increase and decrease of disorder, is established. The theoretical analysis of this experimentally supported model discovers the possibility for a relative increase of the tunnel conductance in \\(sp^{3}C\\)-rich carbon due to the appearance of resonant transmission peaks close to the bands. Nitrogen doping, for example, could be used to vary the micro-structure of \\(a-C:N\\) films as nitrogen incorporation increases the \\(sp^{2}-C\\) ratio [18; 30]. The nitrogen concentration also influences the disorder [31]. Nitrogen doping is therefore not the same as conventional doping however it can still be exploited to modify the conductivity of \\(a-C\\) films [18]. In this regard the result of the present study can be extended for doped carbon structures. A detailed study of nitrogen incorporation in \\(a-C\\) structures has recently been carried out based on a model related to this work [32]. The lifetime of electrons can be nearly constant over a large range of \\(sp^{3}C\\) % in carbon structures having a wide bandgap energy. Since the intensity and position of the resonant peaks can be tuned by the \\(sp^{2}C\\) % to \\(sp^{3}C\\) % ratio and associated disorder under this model, we can effectively predict the nano-electronic device properties in a wide range of undoped and doped carbon structures. This model can also explain the origin of observed resonant features in multilayered carbon systems [25].Based on the provided text, what is the primary cause for the potential increase in tunnel conductance in sp3C-rich carbon?",

        "question": "The mechanism about diffusionless phase transition has received considerable attention due to its great technological importance in steels, ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, and ferroelectric crystals. In the alloys, this phase transition is often referred to as the martensitic phase transition [1]. The investigations on NiMnGaferromagnetic shape memory alloys have shown that the driving force is closely associated with larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants of the martensitic phase [2-5]. Such similar phenomena have also been experimentally observed in BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) and PbZrO\\({}_{3}\\) -xPbTiO\\({}_{3}\\) (PZT) ferroelectric inorganic crystals although the order parameters involved are different [6-11]. For BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal, the first-principle calculations by Hu and Cohen have demonstrated that at zero temperature, the rhombohedral phase is energetically stable, but further study is needed for the finite temperature [12]. However, both experimental observations and theoretical results have shown some similarities in these structural phase transitions, which bring to us to a question of whether there is a general theory for these phase transitions. For ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, the decrease of the temperature can induce the cubic \\(\\rightarrow\\) tetragonal phase transition. But for BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal, the sequence of phase transitions are more complex and as follows: cubic\\(\\rightarrow\\) tetragonal\\(\\rightarrow\\) orthorhombic\\(\\rightarrow\\) rhombohedral [6-10]. Most of these phase transitions have clearly exhibited the couplings between the order parameter and the crystal lattice. For instance, with the variation in the temperature, the coupling of the order parameter with the crystal lattice leads to the variation in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants, and thus the induced phase transition in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys [13-17]. Our recent theoretical results have also shown that the polarization rotation is determined by the crystalline anisotropy in BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal [18]. Therefore, with BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) and PZT as the representatives for these diffusionless phase transitions, we have developed a phenomenological model for investigating the phase transitions. In this model, the phase transitions are energetically induced by the crystalline anisotropy and the relative displacement of the atoms in new phase with respect to that in the parent phase can be predicted. The good agreement between the theoretical results and experimental observations has shown that our theory is effective in describing the phase transitions.Based on the provided text, what is identified as a common driving force for the diffusionless phase transitions in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys and ferroelectric inorganic crystals?",

Figure 1(a) shows the experimental data for the dependence of the components of the saturation polarization along the [100] axis on the temperature in BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal. Figures (b) and (c) show the calculated data for \\(E\\)=0 and \\(E\\)=500 MV/m along the [100] axis, respectively. It has been indicated in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) that the numerical results under zero field are in good agreement with the experimental data. Figure 1(d) shows the dependence of the crystalline anisotropy constants \\(K_{1}\\) and \\(K_{2}\\) (or \\(k_{1}\\) and \\(k_{2}\\)) on the temperature. It has been found in Fig. 1 that the phase transitions in BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal occur due to the complicated dependence of the crystalline anisotropy constants \\(K_{1}\\) and \\(K_{2}\\) (or \\(k_{1}\\) and \\(k_{2}\\)) on the temperature. When the temperature varies, the changes in the crystalline constants \\(K_{1}\\) and \\(K_{2}\\) lead to the changes in the spontaneous polarization directions for BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal. For these phase transitions, the numerical results have shown that for the tetragonal phase the polar directions are the six \\(<\\)100\\(>\\) axes, for the orthorhombic phase the twelve \\(<\\)110\\(>\\) axes, and for the rhombohedral phase the eight \\(<\\)111\\(>\\) axes.

It has been shown in Table 2 that for different combinations of \\(K_{1}\\) and \\(K_{2}\\) values the spontaneous polar directions also are different. For BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\) single crystal, the experimental data have demonstrated that accompanying with the phase transitions there is the variation in the polar directions, and the new polar directions determine the crystal structures of the new phases [6-10]. Therefore, the above numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental observations.

The calcaluted values for \\(K_{2}\\) are negative for the whole composition range and not shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the values for \\(K_{1}\\) can play a key role in determining the phase transition (see Table II). The experimental data have shown that the polar directions for the pure PbZrO\\({}_{3}\\) crystal are the family of \\(<\\)111\\(>\\) axes [24], and for the pure PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\) crystal are the \\(<\\)100\\(>\\) axes [25,26].

As shown in Fig. 2, the rhombohedral\\(\\rightarrow\\) tetragonal phase transition occurs at the critical composition of \\(x_{c}\\)=0.38 when the composition of PZT \\(x\\) increases. This rotation of the polar directions from the [111] axes into the [100] axes occurs due to the switch of the signs of \\(K_{1}\\) values with the composition of PZT. As shown in the inset in Fig. 2, the crystalline anisotropy constant \\(K_{1}\\) is relatively small (\\(\\sim\\)0.01-0.1 MJ/m\\({}^{3}\\)) near the critical composition \\(x_{c}\\). This means that for PZT crystals with the composition near the MPB the polar directions can be easily disturbed (for instance, by the internal stresses), leading to the significant change in the polar directions. Thiscan further be understood in combination with single domain rotation model [18]. For single domains, the spontaneous polar directions are determined by the crystalline anisotropy field \\(E_{K}\\), and for the crystals near MPB this values for \\(E_{K}\\) can be estimated as \\(E_{K}\\)=2\\(K_{1}\\)/\\(P_{s}\\)=2\\(\\times\\)(0.01-0.1)/0.4 =0.05-0.5 MV/m [18,19]. For the compressive stress strength of 0.01-2MPa, we also can estimate the corresponding stress anisotropy field \\(E_{\\sigma}\\)=3\\(\\lambda_{100}\\sigma\\)/\\(P_{s}\\) =-3\\(\\times\\)0.1\\(\\times\\)(0.1-2)/0.4 =-(0.075-1.5) MV/m [18,19]. We can see that the stress anisotropy field is comparable to (or larger than) the crystalline anisotropy field, and can significantly modify the spontaneous polar directions with the crystal lattice changed. Even though the stress anisotropy is taken into account, the effective anisotropy determined by the combination of both the stress and crystalline anisotropies can still be relatively small when compared to those of PZT crystals far away from the MPB. In this case, the saturation polarization can be rotated into the field directions with small field strength (\\(\\sim\\)1 MV/m). For ferroelectric crystals, this can dramatically enhance the permitivity \\(\\eta\\), and thus the piezoelectric coefficients \\(d\\) (\\(\\propto\\eta\\)) [10].Based on the provided excerpt, what is the primary cause for the significant change in polar directions near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in PZT crystals?",

        "question": "For the diffusionless phase transition, the atomic displacement in the crystal cell is very important for the formation of new phases. In Section II, we have theoretically demonstrated that the diffusionless transitions are driven by the crystalline anisotropy. At \\(T\\)\\(<\\)\\(T_{c}\\), the phase transitions occur while the change of the spontaneous order parameter vector is induced in crystalline solids. The change in the lattice parameters for a crystal cell is dependent on the coupling between the crystal lattice and the order parameter vector. Experimentally, this coupling can be associated with the spontaneous strains that depend on the order parameters. For example, for ferroelectric materials, the coupling can be described by the electrostrictive coefficients, and for ferromagnetic materials by the saturation magnetostriction constants. For crystalline solids, the number of parameters to characterize the coupling may be further reduced to two, i.e., the saturation strains along the [100] and [111] axes for a single crystal such as \\(\\lambda_{100}\\) and \\(\\lambda_{111}\\). Accompanying with the phase transitions, the relative atomic displacement of new phase with respect to that of the parent phase occurs, making the parent phase with the cubic symmetry deform and transform into the new phase with low symmetry, and vice versa.Based on the provided text, what primary factor drives the diffusionless phase transition in crystalline solids?",

        "question": "Due to frustration of the magnetic spins localized on Mn atoms a lot of interesting physics was observed in these materials. Non-collinear AFM ground state has the same symmetry as the crystalline lattice [5]. Therefore, the linear magnetoelectric coupling is forbidden. However, experimentalists reported several interesting effects originating from the higher-order magnetoelectric coupling: optical second harmonic generation [6], reversal of AFM order parameter by switching the direction of ferroelectric polarization [6, 7], etc. Recently, exceptionally large influence of the magnetic ordering on atomic displacements and lattice parameters was observed, pointing to the giant magneto-elastic coupling in _h_-YMnO\\({}_{3}\\)[8]. Discovery of three magnon branches below T\\({}_{\\rm N}\\) using inelastic neutron scattering [9] opens new frontier for the investigation of spin-phonon interaction [10]. Neutron scattering experiments pointed out that short-range correlations between spins at Mn atoms exist also in the paramagnetic state [11]. This observation motivated a detailed investigation of the possible magnon-phonon interaction in the paramagnetic state of this material by means of far infrared and terahertz spectroscopy [12]. Additional absorption areas in low-energy regions were found, which could be associated with the multiphonon or phonon-paramagnon interaction. Hence, it is important to have information not only about the long-wavelength phonons, but also to know their dispersion in the whole Brillouin zone because of the short-range correlations of spins above Neel temperature, which is pronounced at the Brillouin zone edges.Considering the effects discussed in the text, why is it important to understand the dispersion of long-wavelength phonons throughout the entire Brillouin zone in the paramagnetic state of h-YMnO3?",

[17]. We have checked our main conclusions (i.e. the stability of the antiferrodistorted phases relative to the cubic phase) for several values of these parameters (U = 4 to 8 eV) as well as without the LDA+U correction and obtained the same result. We used a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV and a \\(6\\times 6\\times 6\\) (\\(4\\times 4\\times 4\\)) \\(\\Gamma\\)-centered \\(k\\)-point mesh for the unit cell (supercell) simulations. Spin-orbit interaction was not taken into account. The experimental lattice parameter of the cubic phase of EuTiO\\({}_{3}\\), 3.90 A, [1; 3; 5] was used instead of the theoretical value of 3.943 A. For structural relaxations which involved changes of the unit cell shape we performed a fixed-volume relaxation to suppress the known GGA overestimation of the lattice volume. In the structural relaxations we minimized Hellman-Feynman forces to 0.5 meV/A. To investigate the structural stability, we utilized \\(2\\times 2\\times 2\\) supercells containing 40 atoms. This allowed us to investigate all possible structural distortions which can originate from the zone-boundary instabilities in a systematic way and to minimize the error in total energy calculations when comparing energies of the different structures. For each symmetry investigated, the initial ideal perovskite structure was distorted according to the corresponding oxygen octahedral rotation pattern, and then the internal atomic positions and lattice parameters were relaxed until the convergence criteria were reached.Based on the provided text snippet, what was the primary reason for using supercells containing 40 atoms in the structural stability investigation?",

        "question": "First, we calculated the zone-center phonon frequencies and eigenvectors in cubic EuTiO\\({}_{3}\\) (see Table 2) and obtained results consistent with other recent calculations. [16] As we mentioned above, in Ref. [24] it was suggested that the TO1 mode is mainly Slater type, based on the observation that the measured value of the mode-plasma frequency for this mode is in the same range as for typical ferroelectric perovskites with active B-site sublattices such as BaTiO\\({}_{3}\\).[25] In contrast to the suggestion made in Ref. [24], however, our analysis of the mode eigenvectors shows that the low-energy TO1 mode has a rather high contribution from Eu displacements, rather than being a straightforward Slater mode. In Table 1 we decompose our calculated eigenslagenbilgreements of atoms in the TO1 and TO2 modes (calculated at the experimental lattice constant) into the Slater, Last and Axe modes discussed in Ref. [24]. In addition to providing a comparison with the earlier interpretation, such a decomposition provides information on the relative activities of the A- and B-site cations, and correspondingly the role of the two cationic sublattices, in the ferroelectric transition. Our analysis shows that both the TO1 and TO2 eigenvectors have in fact similar contributions from the Slater and Last modes. For the TO1 mode we find that the Slater- and Last-like displacements are in phase, whereas they are out of phase for the TO2 mode. This leads to a significant difference in the observed, as well as calculated (see below), values of the mode-plasma frequencies for both modes.Based on the analysis presented in the provided text, which aspect of the TO1 mode in cubic EuTiO\textsubscript{3} is critical for understanding the differences from earlier interpretations?",

Our calculated values are 107 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) and 128 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) for \\(I4/mcm\\) (the symmetry lowering splits the TO1 mode into one doubly degenerate and one singly degenerate \\(c\\) polarized mode), 80 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) and 124 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) (\\(R\\bar{3}c\\)) and 98 to 131 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) (\\(Imma\\)). The experimental value is 82 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), suggesting that the \\(R\\bar{3}c\\) structure is most likely. We note, however, that the soft-mode frequency is very sensitive to the volume of the structure and small changes in choice of volume (GGA versus experimental for example) can strongly change the predicted values. Regarding the mode plasma frequencies of this mode, the experimental value is 1550 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and the average calculated values for the three structures are 1417 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) (\\(I4/mcm\\)), 1433 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) (\\(R\\bar{3}c\\)) and 1382 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) (\\(Imma\\)) all showing comparable agreement with the experimental value.

        "question": "For completeness, we also list in Tables 2 and 3 our calculated frequencies and mode plasma frequencies of the TO2- and TO4-like modes. There are no striking differences that provide persuasive evidence for one structure over another. In the \\(I4/mcm\\) structure, the splitting of the TO2 mode, which is caused by the symmetry lowering, is small (see modes 3 and 4 in Table 2). However the mode-plasma frequencies of the symmetry-split TO2 modes are significantly different: Mode 3 consists mainly of out-of-phase shifts of Eu and Ti atoms, without oxygen contribution, whereas the \\(c\\)-axis-polarized mode 4 has non-zero oxygen displacements which reduce the relative shifts of the Ti atoms, resulting in a lower dipole for this mode. The average value of the mode-plasma frequencies for these three modes is 703 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), which is significantly lower than the corresponding value in the \\(Pm\\bar{3}m\\) structure (925 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) but still much higher than experimental one (400 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)). The average value of the mode-plasma frequency for the TO4 mode (modes 8 and 9) is 727 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), compared with 820 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) for the reference \\(Pm\\bar{3}m\\) structure. In the \\(R\\bar{3}c\\) phase the TO2 mode also splits by a small amount (7 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) with average mode-plasma-frequency of 704 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and the TO4 mode averaged mode-plasma frequency is 734 cm\\({}^{-1}\\); both values are similar to those of the \\(I4/mcm\\) structure. Like in the \\(I4/mcm\\) structure, mode 1 is built by Eu displacements against oxygen cage, with small in-phase contribution of Ti sublattice. The eigenvectors are also similar to those of the \\(Pm\\bar{3}m\\) and \\(I4/mcm\\) structures. In the \\(Imma\\) structure (see Table 3), the wavenumbers of the TO2-group are in the range 154-159 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and those of the TO4-group are in the range 516-537 cm\\({}^{-1}\\). As in the \\(R\\bar{3}c\\) structure, modes in the range 237-283 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) are activated and should be observed as a doublet with a splitting of 50 cm\\({}^{-1}\\).Based on the given text, what is the primary cause for the difference in mode-plasma frequencies between the TO2 modes in the I4/mcm structure?",

        "question": "Strong magneto-structural coupling and multiferroic effects were predicted previously for \\(Pm\\bar{3}m\\) EuTiO\\({}_{3}\\)[16]; here we investigate whether such behavior persists in our newly predicted tilted ground-state structures. Indeed, we find that constraining the spins to be aligned ferromagnetically decreases the soft-mode wavenumber by \\(\\sim\\)7 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) for all three tilted structures; this is the same as previously calculated for the \\(Pm\\bar{3}m\\) structure [16] (7 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)), and close to the value estimated from the low-temperature IR reflectivity spectra at different magnetic fields (3 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)). [23] We obtain a decrease of about 2 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) for all modes belonging to the TO2 group. The frequency of the TO4 Axe mode is almost insensitive to the magnetic ordering. The modes corresponding to tilting of the oxygen octahedra, on the other hand, show strong magneto-phonon coupling, since they cause changes in the Eu-O-Eu angles which in turn strongly modify the superexchange pathways between the magnetic ions. These modes are listed in Table 2 as mode 5. We find that ferromagnetic constraint on the Eu spins hardens this mode in the \\(I4/mcm\\) structure from 164 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) to 218 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), whereas in the \\(R\\bar{3}c\\) structure it is softened by 17 cm\\({}^{-1}\\). Since the tilt mode is not polar, however, the dielectric function is not affected.Based on the discussed causal effects in the text, what is the primary outcome when Eu spins are constrained to align ferromagnetically in the tilted ground-state structures of EuTiO\textsubscript{3}?",

        "question": "In summary, our density functional calculations for perovskite EuTiO\\({}_{3}\\) predict that its ground state consists of tilts and rotations of the oxygen octahedra, rather than the simple cubic perovskite structure as previously believed.

We compared the calculated phonon properties with available experimental data for the three candidate structures to identify the most likely ground state. Our calculated energy differences are two small to allow us to predict which of these phases is the ground state; indeed a phase coexistence might be possible, and additional experiments are required for further progress. In particular, a search for the infra-red-active mode in the range 220-290 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) is a signature of \\(R\\bar{3}c\\) and \\(Imma\\) structures, but is not active in \\(I4/mcm\\) phase.

TIs may be obtained from a semimetal [5] and from a band insulator [8] (BI) in this way. Topological band structures may well be engineered by application of coherent laser beam in graphene and semiconductors. In this paper we propose a new type of topological phase transition in silicene, that is a photo-induced transition from a TI to another TI by changing its topological class.Based on the text, which of the following scenarios most accurately describes a cause-and-effect relationship related to the properties of topological insulators?",
